I‚Äôve purchased these shoes so many times and I noticed how the quality has changed in the interior of the shoe. I was disappointed.
They are  dope love the feel I am the number one puma fan
"My previous rare Pepsi suede blues üíô were a perfect length and and toe width were made properly, my new size 11 all blacks toe width and length turn inward and an inch longer making them somewhat uncomfortable!! üòë It's too bad because they're nice shoes that match any outfit!! Hopefully they'll break in nicely."
Absolutely love em!! they fit perfectly super comfortable and they are very sharp looking. nothing but compliments when I have em on! I‚Äôll be ordering more pairs definitely
Classic Sneaker at a good price. Love me some Puma's!
"I would have given these a 1 star but I thought ok 2. Thin insoles and no support whatsoever. I went to Nike Cortez and they are fantastic. Comfortable, good support and feel so great."
"Squeak when I wLk in them,to loud when I woke and also too big for my foot didn't like them"
I‚Äôve had 2 pair of these now. First pair I bought 7 years ago and they fit great. This recent pair I bought are very narrow.
Wonderful. Great color. Fit is true to size and comfortable out of the box. One of my favorite shoes in my closet now.
Super happy with my sneakers! Very comfortable and will probably buy another color!
I have never been more excited to buy these kicks for myself but the way how I look in them are fantabulous.
It took for ever to get here I don't think I want to order no time soon
"Love the style, but the sizing was way too narrow!"
"I bought these shows and immediately wore them in Texas & Louisiana. The white rubber on the outer sole and midsole are as white as the day they arrived! However my only complaint is that the outer sole was very ""waxy"" and with any moisture on the ground they became EXTREMELY slippery. That waxiness seems to be going away now tho. Great style, very impressed with these shoes."
I truthfully haven't worn Puma's since I was a teenager - but was recently looking for a stylish swede sneaker for walking and casual outings.  I was surprised to see this style of shoe had everything I was looking for - and with the added bonus of also being a comfortable fit.  I am very pleased with my purchase and could well be looking into getting a second pair.
Great looking shoes but to big so have to return..
Bring back the hunter green suede with the white stripe
"I bought the Suede Classic XXI black on black, felt somewhat nostalgic, being that I had these as a teenager back in the 80‚Äôs."
So soft and comfortable. Very nice color. Awesome!
Outstanding. I am 16 years old all over again‚Ä¶ Woo!
"Not only am I extremely happy with my products, the fast service and everything I ordered was perfect!"
The sneakers are comfortable. I wish I brought it in a 7 instead.
I bought shoes online two weeks ago   They arrived a day early and were just what we wanted.  Correct size and color.
"Love the style, fit, and overall product quality. Bought a Puma t-shirt 15 years ago and have been a fan ever since. Thanks guys and keep up the good work!"
Fast and quick shipment. Received order within a few days
This pair replaces a 6 year old pair. Craftsmanship and styling still strong!
"Bought almost 10 items in last month online and in store. Excellent customer service for returning items and even easy, smooth price adjustment. I never have had such good customer service and efficient online processing!"
Not impressed with being charged to return shoes due to an incorrect size
"Purchased 3x pairs of Suede's (Navy, Red & Black) - super comfy & quality material... the laces are a bit long so I double them up, other than that the classic look goes with any style of outfit! I've been a lifelong Adidas Gazelle fan but the Puma Suede's are a better bang for your buck in my opinion..."
"Awesome look and feel! Reminds me of being a kid! Hopefully I don‚Äôt get them all wet and stained like I did then, my wife is meaner than my mom was."
I love these shoes. They are stylish and fit perfectly. So glad that I purchased them!!!!
I have loved these shoes ever since I got my first pair over 10 years ago. They are classic for a reason. They are comfy and stylish. I love them
Great features and quality! Puma products never let me down!! Always very satisfied! üëç
"Bought these for my Bday,it‚Äôs been a long time since I wore Puma,they arrived on time,angle look great,I ordered the black,and I‚Äôm thrilled,wore them last wknd,and I was stylin and profilin!!"
styling and profiling i like these shoes and always have now i have a new pair
Old school is so cool! These Pumas are outstanding üíØ!
"Arch support is awesome looks awesome, Even had a person roll down their window driving by to ask where I got them said Outlets if Altoona Puma Store he said I see ya brother LoL a"
"exactly as expected ... nice shoe, speedy delivery .even an extra pair of laces."
"Nice color, really pops, pretty much goes with anything."
Got a few weeks ago and love the shoes I have the black and the red and now the greys
"The color is a little bit lighter in person than the one from the pictures, but anyway it looks amazing. You'll love it."
"I love my Suede Classic, this is my second pair, I still have the first one, old now but I don‚Äôt want to get rid of it just yet, the new ones are just fantastic, love them and got compliments on them the first time I wore them"
How can you improve on a classic? I know. Just offer more colors. For a while this color was sold out. I am so happy that they got it back in production. These are super comfortable and fit great. Almost every time I wear Puma's I get compliments. If you have never purchased a pair of PUMA's start with suede classics. Just make room in your closet. You'll want one in every color.
"Used this product when I was younger, glad to see the quality is still the same."
i love my sneakers they are so comfortable i have all colors except for royal blue
I always wore these pumas when I was in high school. I was very happy to see them again. I bought a pair.for me and my spouce and are very happy to be wearing.one .of.my favorite shoes.
I bought shoes last month. The are excellent for me and very stylish. Thank you!
Still waiting on my package that haven't came yet thanks
"I love the look and style of my Puma classic suedes - I‚Äôve bought 3 pairs, 2 for myself and 1 as a gift - BUT they run narrow. I bought a 1/2 size larger than I normally  wear and I still needed to use a shoe stretcher to increase  the width to fit."
"Shoes look great. I usually wear a size 9 - 9.5. The 9's fit perfectly. One complaint I do have is that these shoes squeak when I walk. I tried spraying them with suede protectant but it hasn't stopped. Also, shoes have no arch support or padding on the footbed."
I bought a pair of these and after 4 months they are dirty as heck and the insoles are junk now. The last pair of these I had lasted 2 years but this new version lacks in quality which stinks because I've worn Pumas for 15 years. Probably going to try some Nikes next. Emailed customer service since the insoles are shredded after 4 months and they offered me a $40 credit on my next pair. Will probably use them on a discounted pair and find a new brand.
"I wore these back in the 70's.....Just bought a pair and they are just as I remember them.....Great looking, Great quality and Greatly comfortable!"
Love the shoe. Thanks for the fat extra laces. Can't go wrong withe a classic.
Dig these kicks but run big. Want to exchange not return
This is a very heavy shoe it‚Äôs like having a brick on your foot. Its just not very comfortable i wouldn‚Äôt recommend
I should receive a free pair (0: for being a loyal customer
Good service delivery before the date good product
beautiful shoes. I will use them for going out and looking nice rather than daily wear. The red color really stands out on my feet with blue jeans. I always get compliments!
"I am very satisfied with my purchase, I bought the Suede Classics. The quality of the suede is on point. I highly recommend getting these in your sneaker collection!"
I got these shoes a month ago for my birthday and they feel amazing!
"I can‚Äôt wear the sneakers, they are not wide enough for me, and really need a half size larger"
Very Classy! I love them! I have over 20 pairs of your shoes! You have very good prices!
Sole pads were not glued down... shipping was fast
"The look is lovely.  The fit is perfect lengthwise, but it would be nice to have a wider option.  Likely a better shoe for folks with narrow feet."
"I placed the order 2 weeks ago and still no shoes here. Apparently package is stuck somewhere and when I talk to Puma representative they told me to just wait longer, with no option for sending me another box or for cancelation. I went somewhere else to buy shows and I will return this package to PUMA as soon as it arrives."
"Comfy and stylish. Unfortunately, they do not have a lot of traction. That would be my biggest complaint. They also get dirty quickly, but I got them in the marshmallow white color, so that's completely on me. I still thoroughly enjoy them and wear them often."
A fun classic that just plain works! As a plus it is RED too.
"PUMA sneakers are the best. I've had a pair for long than I can remember (they are really durable), and I wanted to have a new pair now. The shopping experience was great, seamless and easy, at PUMA website. When arrived, I noticed a defect of one stich being unpicked. When contacting PUMA's customer support for a replacement I was responded immediately with an offer for an express shipping of a new pair of sneakers, AND, they saved me the hassle of returnning the defect pair and told me I can keep it. PUMA's customer service made my day! I understand defects happen, they addressed it with the cusromer service awerness of the highest standard. I got my new pair literally two days after, and they were PERFECT !!! Kudos, PUMA for your products AND your amazing customer support. As for the sneakers themselves - they are perfection. It looks that every detail was thought about. The shape, the color, the pattern, the style. I love them !!!!! I wear my new sneakers every day now, with pride! Thank you !"
"So comfortable! A little tight towards the toes, but minor nitpick. Otherwise, it is exactly what I was looking for!"
"Love the way they look. But, they've given me a horrible blister under my left ankle bone. I ordered them on line and, unlike Amazon, I can't return them at my nearest Whole Foods."
"Greetings Puma and Puma fans, I recently purchased the Suede Classic XXl Sneakers and have worn them twice so far. Not only do they look good but I feel like I am walking on pillows. That is how comfortable the Sneakers are. The last time that I owned a pair of Puma shoes was when Walt ""Clyde"" Frasier wore them when he played for the New York Knicks. I had a pair of those. I love these shoes"
Brought them for my oldest n he loved them he got them for Christmas
My son and husband loves this shoes so much thinking if getting a backup
I had thwse classic red Puma suedes in the late 80's. They revived in the late 90's and people told me I should be careful not to have my originals stolen off my feet. I threw those out when I got tar on them. I was thrilled to find them online recently and am happily reunited with these old favorites which are better than the originals.
"J'ai achet√© la semaine derni√®re pour ma fille, elle est un peu grand, mais elle l'adore."
Couldn't find these pairs at any shoe store. They were all sold out of the size I needed. So after all the calls I made and finding out no one had them I looked online and they had his size and style. Paid a little extra to get them way sooner like 35$ wish it wasn't so much but it was what it is. My son is happy so I'm happy
Good looking sneakers with any clothes with socks or not
"Small issue with my original issue, and the customer service was outstanding resolving the matter, new items received and are perfect - just like the rest of our Puma's."
Beautiful pair. Love the material and very comfortable. Would totally recommend this sneaker.
I bought this for Christmas and still haven't received it yet tried contacting customer care and its saying my order number doesn't exist
"Puma Suede all the best, love the style and durability. I have 4 pairs and will get more different colors. Highly recommend."
They fit and look great. I love that they come with blue and white laces. They produce very different looks.
"Husband loves these sneakers, classic style looks great with anything."
"First of all, how can you beat the Classic Suedes! Secondly, to have them available in this shade of gray with the gray laces is just a perfect complement with jeans for a casual night out."
I never received the package. I called twice in regards to the address being in correct and they told me the package was delivered.. I asked them multiple times to call fedex for a recall and they declined. I don't understand how the package can be delivered if the address does not exist.
I like my purchase but I would love if you guys would continue to make the same shoe but with a light gray suede and a white puma stripe!!
"These specific sneakers were a Christmas wish, so glad I went on line to search for them. I found the right sisz and color. Ordering was easy and delivery was quick. Also the price was great!"
"LOVE THE COLOR, this is a very comfortable shoe and fits true to size"
"Great shoes, such a timeless classic. Also appreciate the extra pair of wide white laces that were included."
"Very nice, I have yet to be disappointed. I will definitely recommend these to all of my friends"
Definitely a comfortable shoe and goes with a lot of outfits.
Shoes were good. I just didn't like the fact that you offer a promo to make it cheaper but then charge for shipping. That was ridiculous
I bought the same size I always buy and these run narrow. I threw by box away and now can't return
My husband loves the shoes and the color. He is a puma fan
Tr√®s content d'avoir achet√© ce produit merci je le recommande
"Great classic shoes, but my three star rating goes to Puma's customer service. I bought the shoes 3 weeks ago and the color looked different than the picture. The shoe box was thrown in the trash by mistake and when I asked Puma to exchange my shoes for a different color, they said that they will not accept them without a box. I asked them if I could return the shoes in the box for the new color shoe box and they said no. Puma shoe boxes are exactly the same. Why can they just replace the sticker on the box and accept the used shoe return? If I bought the shoes from amazon instead of puma, they would have accepted the return without a box."
"Love these kicks !!! Comfortable, stylish. Goes with whatever you‚Äôre wearing."
It was a great purchase. Good fit too. Package it arrived in leaves much to desired. Plastic bag was torn and shoe box was partially crushed. Shoe was not affected though - expected a little more care but could have been with the delivery folks. Still great retro shoes.
I wore my Pumas to work the other day in a casual office setting and people were just awed by the brilliant color and quality as I was. I know I will have these shoes for years to come but will be getting more colors to compliment my mood and wardrobe.
The black suede started to rub off on the white stripe unfortunately. But very comfortable
I bought these for my boyfriend. He loves them! They fit great and look great on him.
My favorite shoe. I prefer the real suede pumas. I like that the inside of the shoe is lined with smooth synthetic leather vs fabric. I also find the shoe laces to be of better quality
"Bought my new Pumas to coordinate with the tan/brown Puma matching jacket. Excellent choice, I received many compliments on both."
"Excellent shoe for great price, fast shipping! Great service overall."
"Glad I picked these shoes, they are so comfortable and they fit true to size"
"My husband loved them as usual, he has this model in 3 colors now. Would love to have them all!"
stylish and strong i love this product. i really enjoyed wering this product.
"Love this shoe. Been wearing Puma Suedes for 30+ years now, they feel great they look awesome. Just a great shoe."
So cool. So comfortable..it took about a week and a half now I can't even tell I'm wearing them . Love them.
"Purchased for my husband for Christmas, perfect shoe! Looks good on him!"
"These eluded me back in high school. Now over 40 years later, they are just as cool and stylish as then, super comfortable, and fun to have on always!"
Great retro sneakers. But the package as delivered leaves much to be desired. The package came in torn at places and one of the shoeboxes had a crushed end. Good thing the shoe themselves were not damaged.
"Quick delivery, beautiful color, and the sale price was lovely!!!!"
"El producto llego el buenas condiciones, hasta el momento no tengo quejas."
Great look great fit highly recommended} COST was also excellent!
Gave has a gift and was enjoyed to receive the gifts.
Comfortable and sharp looking. People are already asking where I bought them.
I bought these shoes and was sent the wrong size. I reached out to customer service and was immediately helped and was sent the correct size. Fast shipping and delivery. Love the style and fit. Very happy with my purchase!
"I bought these shoes a month ago, and I haven't worn them yet. I've been sidelined, working from home after a pre-Christmas flare-up of BPH."
Hubby gift for Christmas. Really likes old school style. Very happy with quality and style. Order arrived quickly.
"Love the look, but not as comfortable as I hoped they would be. Still a decent pair of shoes to lounge around in."
"Because they're so comfortable I'm on my foot all day. So the price was right and puma brand has been around for years. I met Chris Rock as a child and when he visited his grandparents. In my small hometown of Andrew's south Carolina. He would always have every color, and you know the Brooklyn way of the colored fat shoe laces. This was a hit immediately this is the reason I love the pumas brand. Once you open the box it's as a child anew. All over again."
"I bought these shoes a month ago, glad that I did. Love them!"
I ordered on the 6th of December with hopes of giving it as a gift for Christmas when I did not receive by the 2oth I call and the said they could rush deliver it by the 23rd it never made it on time
Love the color - love the suede. The fit is good. I wish they offered sizes for wide (wider) feet.
I brought two pairs but I didn't receive nothing but one pair
Shoes are heavier than expected and too big. Not a bad looking shoe.
These were bought as a gift for my son. I previously purchased a pair in another color and my son loved them. He asked for a second pair in red. Great product!
"EXCELENTE SUPER C√ìMODO lo certifico lo recomiendo 100% ,,,, como ( PUMA) ninguna ‚ò∫Ô∏è ."
I bought these as a gift and they look exactly as pictured. Delivery was very fast. Thanks!
"This is one of the flyest colors Puma produces ‚Ä¶the fit is too comfortable. Overall, a satisfied customer."
Very cozy.........................................
beautiful and confortable ! really enjoy it and can't wait for summer and show off!
"Found larger sizes, preferred colors and received prompt delivery."
I sent the shoes back because I ordered the wrong size...it's been over 2 weeks and I haven't got my refund back yet! I sent two emails and no one has replied.
My husband and I have been together since 1985 and he told me a little story lately that I hadn‚Äôt heard before. His best friend when he was 14 had a pair of green suede Pumas. He admitted to always being envious of them since he knew being from a family of six children he could never afford them. He is now 55 and unfortunately now in a wheelchair‚Ä¶..So guess what he‚Äôs getting this Christmas?
Excellent beautiful amazing confortable awesome 10/10
Excellent transaction with Puma Brand. Great service and professionalism displayed during my transaction. Sr
"I bought the size recommended, but they are too narrow. There is no option to select a shoe width. The length is fine. I will try stretching them. There should be more guidance on how to accommodate wider feet (I am E or EE width)."
"While the length is correct for my size, the width was noticeably narrow. I have ‚ÄòD‚Äô width or average with a low arch profile so fairly easy to fit. After adding my superfeet thin insoles on top of the existing insole, this lifted my foot high enough so that the upper allowed my fit to be significantly better. Now on to break in the stiff soles."
I just purchased the product. Very pleased just need shorter shoe laces
They feedl very comfortable I love them and I recommend them to anyone
"unfortunately Puma doesn't make E plus sizes.I grew up in the 70's and 80's wearing Pumas and had purchased them from you up to 2006 / 07 .The ""Classic "" one that's offered now is not what they were ""way back then , and are now probably considered to be bestist, gooder and awsumer. made.Thanks,but I'll keep searching for a Sneaker that fits well and as always the Survey is what matters,you get 5 Glowing Golden Stars.Long live the GGS. Thanks again,Kevin ""old"" Snow"
"Very disappointing, because they do not fit, I which you had advice persons to buy a size up from their original size"
"I bought them for someone as a gift, I‚Äôm old skool and love them."
"Let me be the first to say that I normally don‚Äôt go out of my way to write reviews. I ordered my black Puma Suedes simply because I wanted some stylish shoes for the winter. I have never had much luck getting a combination of style and comfort when it comes to flat soled shoes. I put these bad boys on to go run some errands and they are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn! I am honestly amazed! They‚Äôre stylish, and they‚Äôre comfortable! These shoes are definitely a keeper! 10/10 would recommend."
I bought this item and then return it as colour looks so different when I got it in my hands.
"Love my Slick Rick. The PUMA Suede has played a significant role in fashion and street style since its release in 1968. Originally designed as a basketball shoe, the classic sneaker silhouette gained popularity among athletes and sneaker enthusiasts alike."
"Bought as a gift, will not know about the fit or quality until after Christmas. They look great and came in a timely manner after ordering."
I love the colour and quality of these shoes. Forever Puma.
I really love my pumas I plan on buying every color of suede pumas you have im over halfway there I‚Äôve been loving pumas for over 30 years keep giving us good quality products we‚Äôll keep buying them
PPuma like the old days blue strip i wii buy from this company again
"I had been eyeing these sneakers in red and green for a few months, so when they went on sale, I pounced and bought them. I wear a size 8.5 in women's and the site suggested I order a size 7. So fine, I did. The green pair are a little too big and the red pair were wayyyyy bigger than the red pair - probably a whole size bigger! I returned the red pair and ordered a half size down figuring that might help, and sadly, after I wore them for a few hours, I was able to make the final determination that they are too tight. So it's a no-win situation. I am disappointed. :("
"They where very much worth the price, you can't barely get anything for 25 dollars let alone a pair of name brand puma suedes, God bless the sales."
I've given it 4 because I ordered a size 6.5 and my toes are not very happy with that. I've fallen in love with the shoes so I am not returning it. Size up if you must! 6.5W get a 7.0. You'll get plenty of compliments from wearing this ;)
"First time, my order never arrived. Second try, the order arrived in a week which was quick, with the product being in perfect condition."
Comfortable versitale sneaker for everyday wear...
a staple to add to wardrobe i lobe the colors and style
This purchase on line was so easy to make. My shoes arrived so fast. I love it
"Not the advertised color. They're more of a dusty, dull peach color. Wouldn't recommend."
I am very satisfied with the shoes. They are so comfortable and the fit is like they were made for my feet
I brought the sneakers a month an ago and I really like them. Go a lot of comments
Absolutely great shoe. Perfect for the wedding I attended. Came in 5 days from Cali to Bama üíô
Very cute shoes but not comfortable. The first day I wore them I got major sores on my heels. Two weeks later they are still healing.
I bought this one month ago and I am very happy that l did.
I been loving suede pumas since I was a youth and I had to purchase these to add to my collection I have over 10 pair all colors
"I got it for my son's birthday, he really like this sneakers!!"
Sent me the wrong shoe. Did not respond to my customer service inquiry. Seems only option is to just return the wrong shoes and re order. But one is sold out and the other is no longer on sale. Find pumas on other sites like Amazon that actually respond to service questions
I‚Äôm 70 y.o. And these are a great reminder of my first Pumas from over 50 years ago. And I still look very cool wearing them and get a lot of compliments.
one of THE most comfortable shoes in my collection. And the color is a conversation starter.
Purchased them for my husband and he loves the color. He's been wearing Clyde's since 1972.
"I have several pairs of Suede Classics. I love this shoe. It dresses up/down and just looks cooler than most other street sneakers. But... Unfortunately, this pair's materials quality is not great, especially compared to an identical black pair I bought about 4 years back that I've finally worn out. In this pair the suede feels less rich and almost synthetic, plus the white lining around the foot opening and the tongue squeaks, horribly, when it rubs against itself. It's actually embarrassing to wear them in a quiet space. I'm hoping it stops when they're better broken in, but they are a disappointment. If Puma is trying to maintain the price point but can't with better materials, I wish they'd consider offering a nicer version of the same style for more money. I'd pay it happily to get a better shoe."
Super comfy! Great for skateboarding. They run large. I normally wear 8.5 in women‚Äôs and had to rtn the first pair. 8 fit perfect.
"Love the shoe, but the color was not as I expected. It's more like a dark khaki than chocolate/brown. I returned them."
thk u for the awesome shoe's i love them alot Puma is the GOAT
"I am always a 13, and these Puma shoes are too small. I hope I can easily ship them back so I can get an 14 in Puma size? Is there an easy way to do that!?"
I bought theses shoes last month an they fit and wear very well.
I ordered black puma but instead I received navy blue puma‚Äôs. I‚Äôm very disappointed because I specifically ordered the black and that is not what I received.
Got these a couple weeks ago. Way more plush insides than I had expected. Super comfy.
"Ordered womans size 6, received a childs 4.5. Appearance is different. Sending back."
Very nice and comfortable! The color in person is FIRE!!!
"Nice shoes. The problem is, I wear size 10 in Puma (I have 2 pairs). I ordered these in size 10, and they were humongous. So, I sent them back, and have now reordered in a size 9. We'll see what happens."
"I ordered the brown suede classics and received some other color, a light grayish/green. The box was so damaged that I had to tape it back together. I can't afford to do anything about it so I'm stuck with them. I've been waiting years to get some brown ones,thought I finally got them and this happened. I am Puma old school suede classic fan. I own about 10 or 11 pairs in multiple colors. Needless to say I'm very disappointed for the first time with puma."
True to size. Comfortable and Stylish. You will not regret purchasing these.
Why for the life of me can't Puma do the black suede sneaker with the red paw?!?
"Love my Pumas great shoes comfortable, great fit, very happy"
"Love my classics! Great colour. Great fit. Comfortable, simply stylish: classic."
I have been wearing Puma suede low cut sneakers for 20 plus years... They are the only sneaker to fit my Hobbit Feet. I just wish they ran the 30% off sales on them.
"My honey made this purchase because he loved the color, and when we got both our matching pairs we put them on and we got so many compliments! I love them and super comfy."
"Very comfortable, however after three wears the suede started to wear under my ankles‚Ä¶.a little disappointing"
"Great shoes comfortable, everyone likes them! Still in style apparently."
"Wasn't able to get this in a size 14 on the 1st go round, because they sold out QUICK...... but I got em this time....and LOVE THEM! I don't even want to wear them. Cool color. My 30th pair of Pumas"
"The shoe came in perfect it's really good for all events you can dress casual and fancy this will go with almost anything it's a affordable high quality comfort shoe. jeans, dress pants or track/sweats it's really a every day shoe but if kept clean can be worn to more important gatherings/events or interviews"
"Another dope color way on a classic shoe. More, more, more"
"I bought my puma to go with my Kelly Green Eagles jersey. The last time I owned a pair of these puma, in blue was 1985. I loaned them to a teacher who needed sneakers to play a game of basketball. I never saw them again."
Great purchase comfortable sneaker great color goes with all my sweat gear
"These sneakers are unbelievably comfortable, very cool looking and a great price! They look great with jeans, a long cardigan with a tshirt one of my favorite ways to wear them! I‚Äôm extremely satisfied!"
I was so excited when these sneaks were delivered. What a disappointment!! The inner lining of these shoes is plastic. When you first put them on they feel fine but wearing them for even an hour you wind up with blister on your heel‚Ä¶.you can‚Äôt return them cuz they are worn so you are stuck with a piece of poorly constructed merch. What a rip-off. I can not tell you how completely disappointed I am.
"I love the color, but the inner material makes too much noise. These are the squeakiest shoes I've ever had. I hoped they would get better as I broke them in, but sadly they haven't."
I bought this product and I am so happy you guys are all sooo grreat
"I found them very narrow, uncomfortable and made with cheap materials. I tried them on, wore them once around the house and immediately returned them. And now you're asking me to review them??"
"Love Pumas, I bought this shoe to match my Travis Kelce jersey"
Haven't received my sneakers yet it's been almost a month
Like going back in time. The only thing missing are fat laces. Great looking shoe that hasn‚Äôt lost its style! The color is vibrant and FRESH!
I bought this for my husband for our Anniversary. He absolutely loved them and the color was perfect.
great experience ordering. love the product...will def order again.
These sneakers ripped the back of my feet open. No help from customer service at all!
They are perfect. Everyone complements on them. Happy!
Nothing but Puma for my feet. The Suede Claasic XXL is HIM
These are my favorite sneakers. They fit really well and are very comfortable. Shopping on the Puma website was very easy.
Wonderful shoe get a lot of compliments thank youPuma
These shoes are excellent choices I purchased for my wife
Good Good Good Good Good good very good excellent .
"Je l'ai achet√© et je vous le dis, je ne regrette pas, partout o√π je passe tout le monde √† des yeux sur mes pieds et me regardent avec un jolie sourire"
It's dope for a couple of wears but leather would've been much better than suede honestly
More than happy with the product. Fast shipping!!!
Was disappointed. My shoes were extremely narrow and don‚Äôt fit because of it. Normally this is not a problem. Also my son‚Äôs shoes look nothing like the advertised add of them. Very misleading. Both of us need to send them back for credit as we are not able to wear either pair of new shoes we ordered.
Fire Color it looks even better in person . Goes good with any color pants !
I would love if they came in more colors. I have 13 pairs of them. I get compliments from kids and staff at work.
I brought this to wear to Tuskegee Homecoming and it matched perfectly with our shirts
The shoes are even better than I expected! So comfortable
My son loves his new pumas. He says they're very comfortable. I tried to get them as close as the old pair he wore until they actually fell apart on him. So they ate a good durable shoe.
I have purchased this pair of PUMA shoes that I like and am happy to have them.
Bought the red Puma running shoes a few months back and my son loves them!! I ended up buying a pair for my 2 year old grandson too! Father and son matching running shoes!!
All good! Make puma baskets with a suede black stripe.
I bought these shoes 1 month ago and good and great quality pair of shoe
"Love em , been a fan since the 80s , part of the real hip hop scene"
Bought this 2 yrs ago for $40.00. This product is very comfortable but cant understand why after 2 years the price has increased so much.
This is a really nice shoe. It's very comfortable. I'm disappointed that the color wasn't as bright in person as it looks online. I was looking for a really bright orange otherwise the shoe is great
I bought them just weeks ago and I am satisfied with my purchase
A classic design of the work of art in shoe making.
"I've always been a collector of the puma classics, and I'm glad I was able to get them in this color. Absolutely love them."
"Great price and very comfortable, will definitely recommend!"
"A bit disappointed by the shape of the inner sole. Not sure if it's a qc issue or poor design or a but of both, but the right shoe digs into the side if my foot. It seems to be shaped oddly. I have never had any issue with my feet in sneakers - i have no foot issues and regardless of complaints in other shoes about things like width, arch support, etc.. never seem to have any issue. But these shoes I did. Clearly something off. I'd warn the old puma suedes years ago and they were great. What are you doing puma? Make a better product..."
I have gotten several compliments from my friends and family about this shoe! Kudos for what you do with style and comfort!
Suede shoes arrived damaged. Too lazy to go through returns process.
"Everything went perfect, From the online ordering to shipping, Timely delivery, quality shoes, great selection of colours, My daughter loves them, Well pleased ! Thank you, will purchase again"
"Reasonable price, efficient shipping, quality product"
We are very satisfied with the Puma tennis shoes we purchased. The price is reasonable and the quality is excellent.
Just received not too long ago and it fits great and looks super sleek.
"Absolutely love my purchase, will definitely be buying more in different colours..."
Absolutely comfortable! The colors are nice and goes with Summer and Spring outfits.
Bought the Honey Mustard Classic Suedes to add to my collection. Delicious!
"Sleet, linear, low profile and nostalgic just the way I remember them from back in the day!"
It's a nice looking shoe with good overall comfort.
"Nice sneakers, of great quality, and the size is correct. Delivery was fast."
very nice and confort like it vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
Very nice. As expected. Has always been my brand me and my siblings.
Great old school sneakers warm. The color is fire! Warm regards
Great fit. Sizing chart online helped me pick my right size.
"These shoes are great in many ways. Comfortable, stylish, classic. As untreated suede shoes, however, they are extremely prone to getting dirty and extremely difficult to clean. If you wear long jeans, the color from your jeans can rub off on them. If you touch your shoe on aything like a door, a wheel, a pet, or even other feet, the dirt can cling to the shoe. Even using a treatment like ScotchGuard won't keep them free from stains. Be very careful and meticulous if you're going to brave owning suede shoes."
"I bought these thinking they were white suede, much darker. Disappointed."
"I had an issue with an existing pair of sneakers, and once i reached out to customer service they responded quickly. Stephanie N. could not have nicer more helpful. Shopping on the website was easy. Thanks again"
Needs more arch support. Smart looking shoe. Footbed is too flat
4th pair LOVE them! A classic never gets old. rating 10+
These fresh asf im glad i got them before they sold out
The shoes make an odd noise when I walk and they are taking a while to break in and they chafe a bit. Otherwise I love them.
I already sent y'all a swell endorsement...lose it? You REALLY should send me a few free pair as THANKS for the hundreds of pairs I've bought over the past 50+ years.
Great color. I collect Puma suede My favorite lifestyle sneakers. I love the price points. Puma is a great look
Brought few weeks ago. Str8 fit. Kool shoe. Would buy again üòú
I love these shoes! They‚Äôre extremely comfortable and orange!
Great shoes delivered on time and with the right size !
I Love the ice color and the comfort of the sneakers.
Did not come in the colors shown in the picture - shoe laces don't match the sneakers color either
"Bought these about 2 weeks ago love them, looking for the green pair. Restock your colors so I can purchase them..thanks"
Great shoes and this colour looks pretty sweet in real life.
"This is my very first pair of Pumas and I am very satisfied. For one, wearing a size 13 shoe has always limited me on selections in sneaker departments. I was glad to see not only did Puma have my size, they also had a large array of colors to choose from. Also, as someone with a higy arch, I was concerned with how flat these shoes appeard, as opposed to brand options. These shoes are perfect for my work environment and are stylish and comfortable. I wish I could buy 5 more pairs in different colors so I have a different pair for each day."
This is a great sneaker it's sleek and comfortable and stylish good buy
Since I was a kid always love Puma sneakers When I seen them online I wanted a pair Pumas again I am very excited to have them
"Purchased 2 pair, one blue on green. Great look and decent fit. A little tight but I'm sure they'll break in just fine"
"Puma keeps coming out with fresh new colors, I need a canary yellow, just putting it out there!"
Beautiful brilliant colors available in all styles
Bought them for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves them!
I purchased my green Puma‚Äôs a couple of months ago I‚Äôve been very pleased with them
I love the classic puma! I bought these for my brother's birthday. I plan on purchasing a green pair for myself very soon!
"Bought it a couple of weeks back because I had an older version in a different colour. But the new one is super flimsy compared the older model. The inside sole is so thin, it pretty much hurts if you walk in them for more than 20 mins"
The dye from the shoes stained the inside white leather and damaged the white shoe laces as well
"Ordered the Peach Smoothie size 10‚Äôs‚Ä¶.. they were stained grey all across the tips out of the box, sent several emails with zero response. I own 22 pairs of suede Pumas, I‚Äôll never order another pair after the lack of customer response!"
I bought these for me and was scared of the sizing being wrong but the size guide worked with my old puma shoes!
Super comfortable! Wear them almost everyday and will be buying more. Very easy to clean as well.
The God of all classic shoes!!!!!!Great buy for all sneakers heads !!!
Very comfortable and stylish. Got the black I‚Äôd recommend.
I'll be buying them all if they have my size I been rocking Puma for over 40yrs.
I asked for a size 12 US. These sneakers are more a Size 12.5. Definitely loose fitting. Not good.
Comfy. Maybe too comfy. Could use a slightly stiffer midsole. Beautiful shoes but it is close to impossible to clean the suede if they get a stain. Fit is accurate.
These are very nice fit and comfortable. The only negative is the color I got persian blue is darker than the pic online
Very comfortable. Love them! I wore these on my Cruise and they matched perfectly. Thanks
"Perfect sizing, quick delivery, awesome product, great experience."
"The Puma Basket/Clyde/Suede has been my footwear of choice since they were introduced in 1969 (I was 10 and my friend‚Äôs father had a shoe store and was one of the first to import them.). I have worn them continually (except when they were unavailable) since then and they have become my style signature, evoking praise (and sometimes ridicule). Is there anything more I can say after 30+ pairs?"
"Nice shoe, a little narrow. Comes with 2 sets of thick laces of different colors."
"I‚Äôve worn boring shoes my whole life. I got crazy and bought a purple pair and it was life changing. Shoes are great, the insides wear faster than the outside but worth the money. I just want another purple pair :("
These shoes not only look great they fit and feel great as well!!
Excellent purchase. Shoes fit well. I enjoy them each time I wear them.
I bought the shoes a month ago due to the look and price. Shoes are not very comfortable but look good. They make a squeaking sound when I walk.
"I love them. I have gotten lots of compliments since I wore them. I don't use them often because they are my ""special"" looking sneakers."
Real good materials. And with style as well. Real happy!
Just purchased these and I'm already getting compliments!
Birthday gift for my best friend...scored major brownie points... thanks for keeping the classics in the lineup Puma!
"The Puma black Suedes give you awesome style at great value! If you're looking for something slightly different than your run of the mill tennis shoes, seriously look at the line of Puma footwear. You won't go wrong with the Suedes!"
"These are classics i wore in high school over 30+ years ago,and i'll always own a pair."
Bought them a month ago great quality and they fit great
Love everything except the arch. A bit too narrow and digs into my foot. Hopefully it will break in.
"Wonderful shoe, great fit and arrived quickly, the colors matched the screen and I will be buying more"
"The product, Suede Classic XXI, are like the pair shoes I wore when I attended East Orange High School in the late 70‚Äôs. LOL"
"Muy c√≥modos y lindos, los combine con un t-shirt del mismo color y lusen perfecto. Era un regalo para mi esposo"
"I'm 56 and fly, thanks in part to these shoes--boom!"
Great product that shipped out very quickly. Very satisfied all the way around.
I bought this some weeks back and I‚Äôm happy I did excellent
Happy with the product purchased. Arrived in a timely fashion also.
I've been wearing the classic (Clyde) since the 70's. Comfortable and looks good. Still a fashion statement
The runner is so comfortable. Very attractive and true to size. Definitely an every day shoe and most definitely a keeper!
BEAUTIFUL SHOES!! LOVE THEM! MY BOYFRIEND LOVE THEM!!
"I purchased these royal blue pumas and my friends like them so I pointed to puma shop,back in the day sneakers love them.my wife just ordered me the burgundy pair."
The shoes are awesome they fit great. I love how they look with the gear that I wear I will be buying more from puma.
Love the blue suede Pumas. Classic shoe that I admired as a kid. First pair of Pumas.
Look and feel great lots of compliments the shoes also fit well
"Beautiful shoe. Haven‚Äôt worn it yet, but it‚Äôs nice"
So happy I purchased these. They look great! I wish the bright orange were available for sale again.
I love this Shoes!! The Suede is perfect and the color is so great!!
J'ai achet√© cette article le mois dernier et j'en suis tr√®s satisfait √† l'exception j'aurais d√ª prendre un demi point plus grand.
"I wear nothing but Puma suede and Romas and now I'm buying my wife the same, and she loves them!!"
"excellent shoe, color is perfect, love these shoes."
Always love my pumas. Thats all I wear. I'm be ordering more.
I love black five products I'm love representing my culture
"For the last three summers all I've been rockin are the Green,red,grey and the black on black suede classics but I wish they would bring the Olympian blue back!!!!!"
I wanted something cool for my beach vacation and I couldn't have chose a better pair of sneakers. The compliments didn't stop. These cool shoes had me lookin' hot!
The green is not as deep or rich like it appears online. For that reason I am returning this shoe.
"I didn't like the color, so I returned the shoes. I'll pick another color when I receive my refund."
This will be my 3rd pair of puma shoes. I bought a pair of Nike shoes at the same time that I bought my first pair of Pumas. The Pumas are still going and the Nikes are long gone to the trash
"I bought these sneakers for my brother's birthday, and he liked them a lot. They are very comfortable and stylish. Luckily I guessed with sizing. He usually wears EU 44 and ordered 10, which is actually EU 43, but it was true to size."
"title says it all, these shoes have a clean, simple profile and the leather liner and suede upper feel great! The biggest surprise was just how cushioned the insole was. Will definitely be picking up another pair in another color in the near future"
The color of the pumas I purchased is very unique. The color is clementine it has a light orange color.
"I bought two pairs of this color for my wife and I did our wedding and both pair were dirty on the outer white logo. Had to clean them up. Otherwise, I love all my Suede Classics and I have 4 different colors."
The is my second pair. Good fit and comfort for a casual shoe.
I thought these would flow nice with a few shirts I have. To my surprise they went above and beyond. I receive so many compliments on them. Love these kicks.
My boxes were damaged severely. Two pairs of shoes were found in the box and not inside the shoe boxes. If I would‚Äôve known that my shipment would be treated as such I would‚Äôve just went to Nike or something.
This is my second pair. I hope Puma will continue this style. I will wear them forever!
Timeless footwear. Stylish and comfortable. Will always have a home in my closet.
"Fits right, color just as shown. Just as it was back in the day. Quality product. I used to wear the blue ones in high school, my school colors are blue, white and yellow. Very happy with my purchase."
Most comfortable sneakers just like I had in the 70‚Äôs
I bought these a month ago and i am so happy I did. The greatest colour.
"Love all my Puma‚Äôs, I think thy have the best designs. My only wish is that they would come out with a wide foot line. I always have to get a half size larger to fit my fat feet.ü§£"
Outstanding shoe still great quality great price run a little big I ordered seven and a half but I wear a size 8 and they fit perfect
"So happy with my purchase. Sneakers go well with pants or shorts, black or white socks, ankle or crew. Very comfortable. I get nothing but compliments. People don't realize they're Pumas."
They are comfortable and can wear with shorts or long pants
Wish I could upload a picture of how the interior of the shoe is falling apart at the heel. I've had these shoes for less than 2 months and they're already falling apart unfortunately.
"I give it a 5 for looks. And a 3 for fit. I ordered a half size larger than usual. And they are slightly snug. The toe curves in and sometimes pinches my feet. I also replaced the insole for more arch support. The included insoles were ok. Nothing to get excited about. And I feel could have been a little more supportive. I love the suede, and I think the suede will stretch and mold to my feet over time. The style just can't be beat. For all of the issues I pointed out, I'm considering purchasing a 2nd pair, because they are so cool. I wear an 11. But I ordered an 11.5 from puma."
Love my Puma great shoes very comfortable recommend them
"Easy experience with ordering, great product! Wil recommend to others."
"I considered returning the sneakers because they were almost not orange when I received them. After the air hit them for days, the orange came out perfectly When I tried them on, the right insole was folded and stuck in the front. I got it unfold and believe they will end up being what I want and need. I haven't worn them yet, but I believe I made an excellent choice. We'll see."
"These are classy, clean and the color is so versatile to match with dark and light outfits."
A New Old Me from the old school all over again! Hahaha
"Timeless, comfy, cool....everyone should have these in their collection"
"My Puma suede sneaker, ripped along the bottom where the suede meets the rubber. I was walking, not exercising nor putting the shoe under no unusual stress. It did not rub against anything or step on any type of debris. Sad first pair of Pumas‚Äôs I have purchased in 40 years. No where near the quality of the 70‚Äôs."
Back when I was in high school in the mid 70's I wore sneakers just like these in a few different colors (along with another famous athletic shoe brand) every single day. They look great and are comfortable. You can't beat this classic styling.
Comfortable. Style. What else do you want? Don‚Äôt be an Adidas punk.
Real throwback to Puma‚Äôs golden days‚Ä¶ got the green and love them!
I got these sneakers to surprise my husband for Father's day and he loves them.
"I love the style and the color. However, the sneakers fit a little tight/narrow. I have narrow feet. I had to return them for a larger size and they still fit snugly. I guess I will try to expand them on my own and see how that works."
I was very disappointed with the poor material they look üëÄ so cheap
"I brought them for my husband and he was so happy , he say he want blue puma now and he say they‚Äôre comfortable"
I like the color and the fit. I get some complement on the style
I purchased these awesome suede pumas ( have 5 colors already) I wanted to have to the most comfortable shoes i wear. Puma suede wont let you down.
I bought these initially with a nostalgic perspective! I love the fit and comfort!
Very stylish sneakersüëç We very like it!!! Very Very goodüòç
"Very happy with my product. I would highly recommend this product. I had this product several years ago when I was younger, these shoes are still AWESOME !!"
I‚Äôve had this type of shoe before and bought it again but it‚Äôs been amazing now as it was back then. Definitely a casual go to.
"I had the same model before but grey. They are still in good shape and it's been more than 6-7 year. This one, ""Suede"" is already breaking down, there's a hole in one and the quality is not lasting. It's been only 1 year."
"Exactly as pictured, brightly colored. Love that bright orange"
I bought 6 puma and I would not wear anything else. Definitely a fan
"Been wearing Pumas for a long time. I love the classic look of these, but they fit a little strange on my feet. Kind of tight around the toes and loose around the heel."
Nice and comfortable. Love the color and the fit!!
"I purchased these because of the color, but the comfort I found in them was a plus."
"They are nice comfy sneaks, however, in warm weather, my feet get really hot in them due to the interior leather. The interior leather does help the shoe to last longer though."
Absolutely love these sneakers. What sold me was the color. Super comfortable and great value for the price.
I bought these and they completely style any outfit
No doubt ‚ÄúPuma‚Äù classic foot wear love it #Unapologetcallyblack
"Love the color scheme on the classics , and the look is outstanding"
Very happy with the addition of this edition! The sneakers are as nice as I hoped they‚Äôd be. Being cautious of where I wear them to try and keep them pristine‚Ä¶
Finally got me a pair I've always wanted. I love these shoes
The shoes arrived on time and I'm a happy shoppers
Great classic sneaker!! I wore these with a suit to a Birthday Party-awesome look and many compliments!!
I bought these a month ago and it is the 6th pair I have
"I bought the shoes a month ago,the shoes were shipped very quick."
"More comfortable then I expected, I love them I would buy another pair"
Previous puma fell apart had to have new ones. Hope these don't do that
Product is awesome love the classic suede I love all the colors
"Color is great. Wanted to like. Every movement of my foot, walking or not, and the shoes squeaked. Too annoying to keep. Had to return. May try a different pair."
"I love the way the tangerine color pops in the website photo, but the true color did throw me off a bit when I opened the box and saw the shoes with my own eyes. In reality, the color a lot more dull than advertised in the website photo. It's really much closer to a peach color. I still love them as they are, but that detail was still unexpected."
Last forever and very Nevo hip. Lots of inquiries from friends
Got them for my boy birthday. Fit perfectly and comfortable!
"The sneakers. Awesome, the shipping suck crap!! That‚Äôs the only thing I have a problem with the last 3 pair of sneakers"
"i love the grey pair and navy, my favorite ever. fit and quality at its best"
I love these sneaks! They look great and fit well.
"I love the shoes but the customer service disappointed me on misinforming about sizing and lack of communication. If you are a woman, take 1 size down in male. E.g. I wear size 8,5 in Women US which means it's safe to buy 7,5 in Men US."
"beautifully made, suede classics. Probably should've gone with a high size, as full size are kind of wide."
"I have had several pairs of these shoes, and they used to be so much better. They are now super stiff and run very small. I ordered a half size larger than I usually do, and my toe is trying to bust out of the shoe. It‚Äôs a bummer."
"Im so happy with both Black & Navy colorway. Fit true to size and very comfortable, dress up dress down or even for football to skating, this shoes can do everything."
"Absolutely love them! Style , color and and comfort!able"
I bought 4 pairs of the puma suede. No complaints everything perfect. All shoes were In one shipment. Received shoes in a timely manner spoke to customer service. The agent was kind and caring. I definitely will be ordering again. :)
Great quality. Good value. Efficient shipping and providing shipping updates.
"Love them! comfortable, grear price and quality, my 2nd pair"
"Ordered size 11 because I‚Äôm 10.5W. They were long for 11, but way too narrow. Had to return. It‚Äôs a shame because I was excited to have a pair of these throwback sneakers"
Happy with my purchase. You never go wrong with Puma Suede. Classic of all time
"I love these shoes! They take me back to the 80‚Äôs whenever I look at them. They do run a little small in my experience. I always go up a half size with all of the Puma‚Äôs I buy, this works perfect to me. This is a comfortable shoe, that I can wear all day, with no issues. Puma is straining me with all of the sweet new colors they‚Äôre dropping!"
It's been years since I've had Puma sneakers. I really like them and will be making them my go-to...
I have collected Puma Suedes Classic for over 5 years now but I'm noticing recently that Puma is not releasing some of its Suedes Classic XXI in size 6. Puma please make your Suedes Classic XXI available in all sizes.
Love all my shoes! Suedes are the best. You need to re-release blue camouflage again so I can get some
Been in the market for suedes in green with white for years. Either not available in my common size or way overpriced by mark up shoe ‚Äúbrokers‚Äù Thrilled to have these nostalgic kicks from my youth.
I bought these a month ago and I'm very very happy
Purchased my first Pumas a few weeks ago and they still squeak when I walk. Haven't had this issue with any other brands.
Not usually a sneaker girl but I am now. Want them in all colours.
Like it!!! Goood color goood shoes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My son loves them. Always buy one size up- they run small. Nice product
Comfort is good; sized correctly; good price; classic look that brings back memories of my high school years.
Love everything about this sneaker...The color the fit the style is everything.
These shoes are really uncomfortable. painful to wear
I use to breakdance so suede pumas were the shoes to have with the thick laced classic keep ‚Äòem coming I would like too see a money green shoe made that would set the suede collection off thank you!!!!
Can‚Äôt go wrong with this classic shoe. Love this color! True to size.
"SO SHARP, SO COOL, SOOO......UNIQUELY LUXURIOUS & FASHIONABLE, LIKE A FERRARI FOR YOUR FEET!"
I own this shoe in 10 different colors! Y favorites!
I purchased them a little while ago and wore them for the first time today. They were super comfy and the color was fantastic.
I didn‚Äôt receive the while laces that should have been included.
These classic burgundy puma's are beautiful. They are a little wider than I expect is I had to adjust the strings. Thankfully they came with both burgundy and white fat boy shoe strings. I ordered a size 10.5 in men which is my normal size. The burgundy is rich not faded there no scratches shoes were absolutely perfect.
"Many people have complimented me on the Color, top quality shoes, old school."
These old school gems can be dressed up or down. Real recognizes real and I get compliments every time I put them on.
I like the color and design of the shoe.It is so much comfortable and perfect size i bought it online.
Perfect sneakers I bought it for my wife. I recommended it
"My wife bought me a pair because This was the deal when I grew up. They were 42$ and all of us had to have a pair. These were the OG, what happened???? Shame. They used even have the size imprinted on the bottom. The suede feels fake!"
"I am so exited to wear it everything we have a gatherings, even it's snowy outside.Because I love different with the color and they aways say wow,and asking where did I got it,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Classic old school puma suede in light Grey! Love them
I bought these several mo ths ago and they're great but they squeaked for weeks. But very comfy and good looking.
Fit well easy to work in them. I highly recommend this product.
"I bought issues two weeks ago, and I love the comfort and fit"
"I've purchased atleast 9 pairs of the Puma Classic's recently, and am satisfied with 8 of them. However my favorite pair are the Dark Green Suede with a Burgundry stripe, and when I wear them they're the only pair to make a squeaky sound which is very annoying. I'm so disappointed with these shoes that I doubt that I will be buying anymore Pumas."
I really like these. Comfortable old school classic look.
Awesome classic sneaker that never fails to impress
"Great product, been wearing these shoes for over 50 years!"
Nice shoes but too narrow. Had them when I was younger had more nap to the leather.
These slippers are great they're very comfortable and soft and they keep your feet warm in the Winter. I wear them everyday and they are held holding up very well. I even bought once for m 3 sisters for Christmas. They love them too!
"I had Pumas in the 70's in high school, these were nothing like the old ones, uncomfortable, the stitching in the front rubs against the outside of my foot, can't wear them. They look cool but are not a retro to the old shoes."
The uppers are great! But I was really surprised by the cheap construction of the sole. It‚Äôs easily twisted with two hands. There is no arch to speak of and it‚Äôs uncomfortable to wear for any extended time. I was hoping for more.
"Man I love them sneakers, so stylish and versatile, I can be casually dressed with it, or semi formal..Good value for money"
I bought these to replace my all-suede Liga with gum soles. This is really a different shoe in every way. I wish the all-suede Liga with gum soles was still made. It was a great shoe for indoor soccer and for casual wear. This shoe's sole is way too thick and heavy for soccer.
"Bought these for my eldest boy, Great looking dogs! Good value!"
They changed the tongue material. The new tongue is: slippery on the foot facing side and traps heat so it's kind of sweaty. Won't buy another pair until Puma changes back. It's a shame because the iconic styling is still cool.
"Comfortable, great shoe for bumming around. Classic style, subtle, not in your face ridiculous. You could wear these for many years and not look stupid."
Happy to wear these for sports or going into town.
Love this shoe! Have the suede blue and yellow. Size is true. I‚Äôm a 14 and never a problem picking these up thanks
"Stylish shoe , great product, always classy , still doing great things"
Purchased last fall and I wear them quite frequently. They look good with anything I wear.
"Really happy with my sneakers , the're reslly nice and comfortable"
"I bought these shoes because i wore them years ago when in college. A little disappointed in the comfort level, but not much"
"I‚Äôve worn these for years and they never get old, always generating complements. The fit and comfort are terrific too."
They make so much noise when u walk just sounds like plastic so sad don't know what they did differently
Heavy shoes and emiditly started to hurt my feet and I only wear Puma shoes.
My son loved them and is super happy with them ‚Ä¶..
I have many pairs of Suede and this one is great!!
I‚Äôm so happy with these‚Ä¶one of the most comfortable sneakers I‚Äôve owned. They look great and are really well made. A+++
Always loved this model. Been buying them for years. This latest pair is not made the same. Toes are too narrow and shoe too wide. Why did the fit change?
I bought a navy blue pair as well as the mustard color. They fit a narrow foot and I have had to stretch the toe box on both pair. They look good with almost anything I wear.
These are nice comfortable suede kicks red n black very classy just try n not get them wet as suede doesn't do wet ...
I've been breaking in this pair of suede classics for about 60 hours and the soles still hurt my feet to wear. I end up going back to my 2 year old pair of suede classics. I'm still hopeful that they will become more comfortable because they look so good
The insoles are separated from the foot bed and they make noise when I walk.
"When I open the box after excited to get my new pair of pumas. I started to get upset. I I noticed a few differences right off the bat that I really didn‚Äôt like first and foremost. Ôøº the shoe seems to have a smaller toebox, whereas my previous ones from 2019 had a longer one and looked way better imho. I miss The original logo on tongue. Not a dmealbreaker but miss the leather insole. The last materiÔøºal did wear out and get dirty; there has to be something better to use than leather. Just bring back the old/2019 era shoes please :)"
"This was probably my 6th pair of these over the years and Puma has made some fatal changes in the newer version. The insole is now a grid of vertical rubber that slices up the pad, then your socks and foot. It is actually painful to walk in these. This style used to be so simple and good and now I will never wear Puma again."
"I hadn‚Äôt bought a pair of Puma‚Äôs since the original Clyde‚Äôs of the 70‚Äôs. Wish I would have just kept the memories. I bought a pair of Clyde‚Äôs Legends in leather, plus the suede in red and black. Toe boxes are too small, waffle-iron soles have the consistency of plastic, but they look great! üòÇ It‚Äôs mich more comfortable to shoot basketball in the gym while wearing a pair of Crocs. I tried to make them work, but all three pair are in the trash now, as they were giving me plantar fasciitis. At least I got them on a good sale for $40 a pair."
I don't have a wide foot and never buy wide shoes. These shoes are so uncomfortably narrow I rarely wear them. It is is shame because they look great.
"I still have my black/black suedes from 2019 which doesn't seem to be made anymore. The most noticeable difference on these current ones is the big green/white puma logo on the tongue, which my old ones do not. I do not like these versions. Can you bring back the other ones??"
I owned a pair of green Puma Clyde shoes back in the ‚Äò70s. Great get that suede feeling again!
Honestly some of the best shoes you can buy and for only 70 dollars like don‚Äôt sleep on puma suedes bro better than vans
"Welp, I've had these two pairs for about 4 months now. I alternate them every day. The black pair I bought, still holding up ok. The grey pair I bought, not so much. The insoles are crap. They are thin and do not hold up. Both pairs have thin insoles. There is already a hole in the left heel of the grey one and you can feel how thin and flimsy the insoles are now. This will probably be my last pair with you guys. With inflation, I need to know my money is going to go far. $80 for a pair of shoes that look good on the outside but are disentigrating on the inside within 4 months? Come on. No thank you. You guys were making good stuff up until about the last 2 years or so. It's a shame because these are cool shoes. Also, on your ""cons"" section, you really should have ""quality"" on there as an option. I understand now why you don't."
They changed these! They are so uncomfortable now! The right foot is like faulty! So narrow. Aweful waste of money! I wore these for years now they are aweful!
"I've been wearing this shoes for a while and I am absolutely glad, that I bought them."
"I've been wearing suede's for eons. They are my favorite casual go-to shoe. I've always loved the color schemes and comfort. There is something off with this version as many others noted in their reviews. For me, the first thing is that the insoles were different on each shoe. The left shoe felt fine. It was pretty comfortable and fit well. The right shoe on the other hand was not the same. Right where the inside stripe comes down, there is a bump. No matter how many times I tried to adjust my foot or push it down, it didn't go away. I wore these nearly every day for over a month and I just couldn't get comfortable. I thought maybe I got a defective pair. So I went to a Puma store near my office and tried on several pairs. They were all the same. I bought the black with red cherry tomato stripe. The color is much different than the picture online. It's a coral color, not red. Puma definitely didn't lose a customer but I hope the next version is better."
"I bought these same exact shoes either in December of last year or the beginning of this year at my local Foot Locker because I liked the design and color and the price point was honestly hard to beat compared to the other sneakers I was looking at. I honestly don't do much in these shoes. I wear them every day but it's not like I'm doing much. I just drive to work and when I get there amd mostly standing or doing minimal walking or even sitting, so I was kind of disappointed when recently I noticed that the insoles had kind of ripped in certain places, revealing a sort of rubber mesh sole underneath. I actually had to remove the one from my right shoe because it had gotten so ripped up that it wouldn't stay in place and was uncomfortable whenever I put the shoe on. I did order some shoe inserts online (not PUMA) to replace them but I don't really understand how this would happen. I have never had a pair of sneakers do this to me before and am pretty disappointed with the quality."
Please make wider shoe's especially the classic suede!
will still colour be back or where can i order this colour and get it in a day?
I've been wearing suedes for years. Although they run a bit narrow I'm happy with them and grab new colors every year or two.
I was very happy with my purchase. No flaws in the sneaker suede or the structure. I even bought a second pair. Blue and black. No more Nikes for me.
Hey suede pumas are. The best I'm gonna get all colors
Fast delivery good qualit√© Easy with internet site
Love this shoe. Love the all black. Very comfy. Would recommend.
"When you find an iconic pair of shoes that fit great, are durable and want to wear them, how can you not get another pair?"
"Simple, classic and comfortable, these shoes are perfect wearing shorts or casual Docker-style pants."
"This shoes has a natural, clean look and is very comfortable. The style is simple but stands out. I would purchase these shoes again! Great buy!"
"Buy a 1/2 size down ‚Ä¶! Ordered a man‚Äôs 10, fit like a ten and a half ! Way to big !"
The shoes became extremely uncomfortable to wear after two weeks. I wore them every day but now I dread wearing it at all. They look nice but I would return them if I could. Don‚Äôt waste your money on these.
The insole is really bad quality. The top part of the insole already died down already causing my feet to hurt and have blisters and I have to go purchase a third party insole to replace them. I bought a pair of Basket before this and it's still going good. I bought a pair of Clydes recently and I hope it doesn't end up like this. Stop cheaping out on insoles and quality of the sneakers.
"I‚Äôve been wearing Suede Classics for years, the new incarnation is narrow and just feels lower quality."
"I have worn a size 10 forever. These are tight, like a half size too tight at the toes and it feels like the arch support is in the wrong place and inconsistent on both shoes. Shoelaces are too short. Not much support or room to breath. I want to love these and perhaps a half size up would be better but too late to return I'm sure. Sadly I want to wear them but I've worn much more comfortable brands."
"I wore Puma's for many years and continue up to 2 years ago. You now are hiking price and lowering quality. That is unfortunate. Get back to the shoe where Clyde Frazier was the spokesman. By the way, not why white with a Black or blue stripe?"
"About a a month and week ago I bought like literally two puma shoes. First shoe I bought was the Puma smash v2 type at the Puma outlet in somwhere near the airport. However, I was not looking for the smash v2 type, yet I wanted the suede type. Just because they did not have enough colours at the outlet, I decided to go for Puma smash v2 black and white with size 11.5 or 44,5. It was just fit in, but it doesnt give my foot breathes (think Im still growing though it was just 1 inch). It was ok for a while. Afterward,  a month or so I bought my second Puma shoes at Footlocker. This time was a suede type and  im quite happy, although it was only black and beige colours. Thus, I went for it with 12 or 45 size, and it was just right to my current size. Gave my foot breathes and spaces. Somehow after worn like days or so I felt the in sole shoe of my right shoe felt uneven compared to my left shoe. It were not neat. The finishing of the product wasnt so smooth. It made in Cambodia"
"Haven't worn Pumas in years, but was pretty excited to buy a new pair. But these are too narrow, the heel slipped, and they're fairly clunky. The minute I put them on I knew they were going straight back in the box, sadly. I wear an 8.5, doesn't seem like going up or down a half size will help. Just FYI."
Within about two weeks the heel was ripped out and I did not even wear them every day. About four weeks in the right shoe makes a noise every time I step it sounds like I have walking gas.
"84% recommend this product, in my opinion that is very poor. Very poor"
"Not sure why there are no reviews on here but these shoes are amazing. They fit just as or more generous than Adidas and are very comfortable. I was worried about ordering these as people recommended sizing all over the place. I am a men's US 10.5 with a slightly wider foot. I wear wide (EE) hockey skates, and wear Gazelles and Stan Smiths in 10.5 which fit but find them to be more narrow than say Superstars. I tried these Pumas in a men's 10.5, 11, 11.5 and 12. By far, the 10.5 (my normal size) fit the best. The width of these are much more generous than Gazelles and Stan Smiths in the same 10.5 size. The 11s fit okay but I needed to tie the laces up noticeably tighter. The 11.5s were way too big. Honestly, I am completely surprised by how well these fit. From the sounds of other reviewers online, I was expecting these to be way too narrow, small, and tight. But, I was very wrong. Order your normal size or potentially go half a size down even. I'm not sure about other styles but these shoes are TTS and even on the larger side as they are wider than several other Adidas shoes in the same size. I also tried Vans Old Skools in a men's 10.5 and those were more narrow than these Pumas."
When I got my pumas in 2010 they were suede clouds. My foot would glide in and snuggly fill the shoe without any need for retying. These new pumas seem to be made of canvas like converse. I have bunions on my feet and the old shoes are great but the new shoes cause me endless amounts of pain when I walk.
"I've loved these shoes since I first discovered them about 15 years ago. I've had maybe 5 or six pairs in that time and they've always felt pretty much the same. I just bought a new pair and ... Puma replaced the fabric inside the heel and tongue with plastic. I can't believe it‚Äîmy foot now slips around in the heel area, the tongue feels flimsy and uncomfortable, and I can only imagine how much sweatier they'll be. Seriously, Puma, you're making a huge profit on every pair you sell. Don't skimp on the quality!"
I have had a lot of shoes over the years . And I have found my perfect shoes I love the Pumas more than any others . They are the most comfortable washable cleanable shoes I have ever owned I would not buy any other shoes but pumas my opinion my feet I wore Nikes Jordan but my preference is puma.
i find these kicks are great with working around relaxing and even wearing them with a suit and tie with jeans
"It's a classic, pairs with anything. I've had this shoe on repeat for years and can say it consistently lasts about 3 years of intermittent street wear before the sole wears through or toes push through the suede. Wish it had more support in the sole or hidden reinforced toe fabric."
why don't they come in size 12? I would buy several pairs and I am sure others feel that way.
"Being in a wheelchair with MS I can't control much anymore but my feet can look good and they do. Puma suede baby, stylin on this 50 year old guy in his wheelchair. THE NEWEST CLASSIC... They fit perfect on my size 13 feet and I love the stitched on souls, no Glue! The Green with the red stripe are next on my hit list. (they all are really!) Thank you for the happiness, it feels good to feel normal again."
"I love them. Classic Suede Pumas were my childhood jam. While others were doing the Converse thing, I was way ahead of the curve!"
I think I will forever be a Puma fan. I always have at least two pairs I rotate and they are my go to shoe for you name it. So comfortable and stylish ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
They fit way too big. An 11 is more like a 12 Now Im stuck with shoes too big
"These shoes are iconic and look great but when trying them on each size had a problem to small or too big, to wide or to narrow. There was no happy medium it‚Äôs a shame that I can‚Äôt really wear them with comfort but I‚Äôve done the best I can."
"Bought my new pumas online. Easy order, quick delivery and easy return of a second pair. I‚Äôll be back."
the right shoe squeaks every step. can't wear in quiet environments without people looking at me and smirking....
I had puma suede back in the 80‚Äôs. Loved them then and still love these new ones now Even the same colour as I had back then too!
"Although all of the previous shoes I have ordered have been fine, I ordered the same size and for some reason they were too big this time. I threw the box it came in away, now I have to drive 40 minutes to the PUMA store to return the shoes."
"Not what they used to be. They don‚Äôt compare to the ones I bought before. Material is cheap and they are not as comfortable.It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre almost made of plastic. Oh well, they just don‚Äôt make things like they used to!"
I‚Äôve been a Puma fan for years and for the past decade or so been wearing suedes one after the other. Just received a pair of black on black and they ‚Äúsqueak ‚Äú as I walk. Not the sole but the upper tongue area. The fit and quality remain the same but now I can‚Äôt be a secret spy
"I got just the right colors and right fit, just love them!!!"
I like these new shoes. They look and feel great. The only challenge I had experience is that they are a bit narrow.
"came quickly, Shoes are so comfortable. love the color of both the hat and shoes."
"Picked up a pair of the 1968 vintage Orange Suede Pumas...dare I say I was back in Junior High School...well at least I thought I was...just a classic, fun, different look...I mean their Pumas! The orange color isn't too bright and it definitely gets some looks...."
"Hello. I am pleased with the great products puma continues to put on the market. While I appreciate the quality and comfort of the classic puma suedes that I have worn for over 20 years, I don't appreciate the high prices. The suedes are never part of the online sales or promotions. Feels like a bait and switch everytime I get a friend and family promotion or email regarding the latest sale. Please know that these are the cornerstones of your styles and that you can't price your beloved customers out after years of loyalty. Thanks for your time!"
Ive worn Puma for decades and I have 3 pairs of Puma classic suede that are 15 plus years old and like new condition These are not even close. The padding on collar is horrible not even close to my Puma suede classics The tounge is pretty weak as well. When I walk the outside of my foot looks like its going to go through the side and Im a thin guy. Im done with Puma. They were good at one time. Not anymore
"I was a bit worried about the fit of these sneakers but I was blown away with the fit & comfort. It feels like it was custom made just for my feet! I actually got the Adidas Superstar sneakers at the time and I can honestly say the Pumas win, hands down! Love the Peacoat color, it goes well with everything in my casual wardrobe."
"Hey where did we go?..... I was itchin' for a new pair of shoes, and deep in the recesses of my head was a pair of shoes I always loved. Since we moved back to the states, I was never able to find another pair and I languished through all the other ""shoes"". With each passing year, my heart grew fonder for those elusive unicorn shoes. Do you remember when....? Year after year followed, then finally 45 years later there on your website: Blue Swede Pumas. I couldn't believe it! When they arrived, it was like Christmas. I laced them up, and cast my memory back! I was swaddled in the goodness of those Pumas. Man, I love these shoes!"
I am very please with my order. Thank you!!!!!!!!!
I just happened to be on FB when I saw the Suede Puma promotion. At first I was skeptical since there's lots of fake ads. So I went directly to the Puma website and boom!!!! There she was. The authentic old-school Suede Puma's. Without hesitation I ordered it. Received them on a timely fashion. Put them on and I was in heaven. Brought back my 80's b-boy days! Love love love them!
After a month i had finally received the shoes today. I had to call bolth puma and FedEx well over 10 times to get a basic address change. And after all that they are supposed to be size 12 granted they are in length although not in width unless your a twig. And guessing on how bad FedEx acted and how slow puma was to fix its not even worth my time trying to get a refund or replacement. (Buyer's beware FedEx) Side note: great quality suede leather for the price
i have all of the colors in suede just waiting to see if you come up with new ones would love one in hot pink or lime green .Just love them
"This product is great, I love the colors of the shoes."
The orange suede is killer. Love how unique they are.
I am the only one in my neighborhood with that color love
"I had a pair of these in high school and liked them. These look great and are very comfortable, like a pair of custom house slippers. However, the vinyl trim rubs against the tongue and squeaks like crazy. I don't remember this being an issue in the 1980's version. Hoping it will go away as they break in. I really like the extra set of laces that came with the shoes, giving me the option of matching or contrasting white laces."
This is my third pair of Suede's in six months and I love them. I wear a size 12 and have found that I need an 11 in these.
Good quality nice fit what I expect from puma and have always gotten from them reasonable prices nice style
"i had a pair of puma suedes size 8. Loved them. Once i finally accepted it was time to part with them, I same-day purchased another pair online. Same style same size. THE NEW SHOES WERE SIZED DIFFERENTLY. I was so disappointed. The return was simple enough but I have yet to see the refund to my credit card"
Retro style and comfortable. I love them and wish they had different colors.
"I've been using Puma soccer and indoor sports and training shoes and sneakers for 50 years. These suede sneakers conform to all the great things I've always loved about Puma -- comfort, sizing and quality of manufacture. Would definitely recommend."
"Love the color, shoes fit great. Wonderful Father‚Äôs Day gift from my daughter"
They fit like the best of the line. It's Ol skool and my Style
"Sneakers are good. Wish I had a matching pair of 3/4"" laces to go with them"
Nice look but fit is not great - would not buy again.
"I was a big Puma fan as a youth (pushed no doubt by my love of Clyde Frazier), and I remain so decades later. I hadn't bought a pair in years, so I was excited to do so. The shoes are classy looking, stylish and smooth. They hurt after wearing them the first day, but I think that's because I take longer to break in shoes. Will buy another pair in another color soon. Something else I discovered: The suede shoes don't seem to go on sale, nor do any discounts apply. Was a little disappointed in that. I wish they had been clearer about that. I waited to buy for a sale and found the price was the same. If I had to do it over, I would buy again ... only soon."
Been wearing the classic suedes for 30 years. Hope to wear them 30 more.
"Really liked the shoe, but sizing was way off. I normally wear a size 8 but ordered size 8 1/2 because of the recommendation in product description, shoes were still too small. My other PUMA shoes are great, so I am looking @ a different model."
"The comfort is not bad. It's just a shame that the stitching on the shoe tongue is gone, like the cheaper version of the Stan Smiths, and the design is no longer as good."
These sneakers are the most comfortable I own. Ordered the Gray and Blue one's thinking about adding the Black and White ones to collection.
"Didn't do anything especially dirty with them, just walked around mostly indoors. Dirt clung to this pair like none other I've bought before."
The suede solid black look and feel great on my feet
Fit great right out of the box. Put a bunch of miles on them right away. Very co portable and they look great.
I forgot How comfortable the pumas are used to wear them back in the 80s in the 90sGoing back to the PUMA
Nice comfort and look. Takes me back to the 80's style.
"The upper definitely didn't look or feel like suede (especially like in the photos). I think the ""synthetic leather"" was on the outside. The shoes were also a half to full size too big."
"It was time to replace my 10 year old Pumas. The new ones are very comfortable, stylish, and make a statement. I also got some hats to do some advertising. The fit is rather snug putting them on, so I use a shoe horn to save the heel extensions. Love the colors! The laces also stay tied, an improvement over my older ones."

"These shoes look great and fit true to size, however, they didn't come double boxed. It literally came in a black garbage bag. Other than that, this was my only complaint. PUMA, you guys need to step up your game. I've bought shoes from the Nike and Adidas website and their shoes always came double boxed."
"Shipping was extremely slow, and after all the delay I couldn‚Äôt fit the hoodies. They run small. I had to send them back. The shoes fit fine."
"Good looking product, stylish and fits great. Compliments all day."
you guys are doing a great job the puma product rocks whether its footwear or clothes puma is number one to me keep doing what you guys do
"I been a fan of Puma since back in the mid 80s, back in the break dance era , suede Pumas with fat shoe laces and Puma sweat suits. It is amazing to have found classics back in today‚Äôs time. I love them. Thanks Puma!"
"Loving my classic puma's, get plenty of compliments"
I had these in the 80s when I was a kid just bought three pair getting ready to buy three more
"I had these shoes as a young man and wanted new ones. :-) They are nice but a bit tight on my right food by the outside toes box. But I think over time they'll soften. I like them,"
I have been wearing these pumas for 43 years and I won‚Äôt stop because the shoes are classics.
"The suede I bought were the same type and size of previous suede shoes. The new ones size is not correct, too big and very I comfortable."
As a kid in high school I had a pair of puma Clyde's and a pair of classics in blue suede. I loved the style and seeing these classics -- this time in red -- brought me back. But these Pumas are also very current. I can wear with jeans or add a pop of color to any casual work outfit. And they are very comfortable.
I've had Clydes for over 40 yrs and I continue to like them. Very lightweight and comfortable too. The orange color is easy to pick up on in the haze of the sunny fingered dawn!
I've worn Clydes/Suedes for more than 40 years. They're the most comfortable and best looking sneakers on the market. There is no substitute.
