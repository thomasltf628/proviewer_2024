DD in Carmel,5,"I wore this jacket everyday for two weeks while we were in Scotland (September 2023), and it was absolutely perfect! Temperature was between 55 and 65 Fahrenheit everyday, with rain everyday too. I wore a T-shirt and a scarf and was quite comfortable. The hood is fantastic and did not really need an umbrella at all. My husband got the men's version before we left too, and he was quite happy with it as well. Nice wind-breaker too.",6 months ago
Dodi,5,Just what I was looking for! I had a similar one that was my go to jacket. I lost it in May while on vacation. I’ve been searching but haven’t found the same one. This one is really close.

Karosett,5,"This is my second Columbia rain jacket as I have another one in the color of watermelon. I would like one in every color.

CKB,5,Purchased this for an Alaskan cruise in August. I think it will be perfect. I usually like XL..but with no stretch exchanged for XXL so i can wear layers underneath. I think i will get much use from this jacket. Great quality and love the color,8 months ago
Bevgo,5,"Light weight, beautiful color, fits well. Haven't had a chance to wear it in the rain yet but material feels like it wouldn't absorb the rain. I will likely wear it as a light windbreaker even when it is not raining. Love that it blends in with the environment so I can wear it while photographing in nature.",8 months ago
Mara555,5,This is the perfect lightweight rain jacket with a hood. Great for warm weather or could be layered underneath for cooler days. It's adjustable along the waist and the sleeve cuffs. It comes in a variety of colors. Packs easily for travel.,8 months ago
Pam P.,5,Wonderful rain jacket! It is lightweight but durable and very comfortable even in the summer heat.,9 months ago
Violet S.,5,"I am thrilled with the quality, fit and style of this jacket. I got the Dark Sapphire and it is a perfect shade that is somewhat neutral/versatile and will combine well with the warmer, earthy, golden tones I tend to wear. I plan to take this on a Spring trip to Japan, I just can tell it will travel well and do what it’s supposed to do in rain and wind. The length is great - not too short like so many windbreaker jackets. I am size 4-6 with somewhat broad shoulders. The small fits perfectly, roomy enough but still looks flattering. Excellent detailing too, a smart wardrobe piece. Well done, Columbia!",10 months ago
Heather G,5,"Nice light rain jacket, I was looking for something not bulky, easy to pack down and 100% waterproof. This jacket nails is on all points for me and the blue color is great imo.",11 months ago

J Massey,5,This is the perfect rain protection. It protects nicely from the rain and is a great windbreaker otherwise. Feels good and looks good.,a year ago
Columbia Fan,5,"I bought this jacket in preparation for a trip to theme parks where I anticipated getting drenched on water rides. It is extremely light weight while still being surprisingly warm. This has become my favorite jacket that I wear all winter long. If the temperature really drops, I wear another jacket underneath. The densely woven fabric will keep you warm while the inner layer of mesh keeps you dry. This really has become my favorite jacket. I now own three, just to have them in multiple colors.",a year ago

Angela,5,"I love this jacket so much I had to buy a second one! I wore my old one before it got a small hole in it to a concert early in the summer and literally sat in the rain for 3 hours before the show started. I was as dry as could be under this jacket. When I discovered the small hole in it after the concert, and couldn't find a patch kit for it, I bought a second jacket and also bought the matching pants as I plan on using these for backpacking too. I can't say enough about how nice and dry I was. The jacket also acts as a windbreaker as well. Living in Washington state, I'm questioning why I didn't discover this jacket years ago!!! Worth every penny if you're looking to stay truly dry :-)",a year ago

Mayra,5,Really satisfied with my new jacket. I tried it under the tap and it was really waterproofing! Loved it!,a year ago
Bunny,5,"I ordered this as I was preparing to return to the muggy, humid, and thunderstorm-y reaches of central Ohio, needing something both breathable and waterproof, as well as light and packable enough to be carried around in a satchel. I was curious to see how Columbia's Omni-Tech compares to the plain Gore-Tex of past jackets I've had. I've forgone my umbrella a few times in order to see how well it works, and I'm very pleased. The jacket's hood stays up reasonably well even in hilltop winds, and it's as waterproof as I'd hoped (no more getting drenched in surprise downpours!). It's compressible, and on days when I don't have a bag, the fabric isn't too slippery for me to tie it around my waist. In humidity, it does okay in terms of breathability, though anything gets sweaty if you're moving around a lot and exerting yourself in that weather (in which case the rain is more a relief than anything). It also makes an excellent windbreaker. On top of all that, it escaped the petty issue I've had with past raincoats: it wasn't unbearably noisy! It crinkles a bit, but it doesn't sound like someone is crumpling paper in my ear when the hood is up. A small thing, but much appreciated! My only complaint would be that, even when fully loosened, it can feel tight around the hips (mine are fairly wide), and wearers with wider hips or larger stomachs might find that a hindrance. All in all, though, a very well-made jacket.",a year ago
Dora P,5,Perfect rain jacket!! Breathable and dries quickly. Tested it out over the weekend.. got caught in a major rainfall and very impressed with the water protection. I definitely recommend.,a year ago
SeattleSue,5,"I go back to this jacket whenever I need a new one. I think this is my 3rd in 10 years, and I've never worn one out, just changed sizes. The construction is great: it keeps me dry and comfortable and it's practically all-season for the PNW. The fabric is what I would consider somewhere between light and medium weight. The mesh lining keeps it from being clammy in warmer temps so in the summer I use it as a windbreaker on the water or in the mountains. The closed seams mean it also keeps me dry and warm when used as an outer layer in cooler temps during spring/fall/winter. It keeps the rain off and I like the adjustable hood. The fit isn't too slim or too bulky--just right! For me, (5'4"") the length is perfect, hitting just below the hips; being shorter, I also appreciate the ability to velcro the cuffs tighter so they aren't too long. Zippers are strong and durable. Best of all, it rolls up nice and compact for stuffing into your pack or luggage--perfect travel jacket!",a year ago
Kylie J,5,Lightweight rain jacket that easily folds up into it's own mesh pocket for easy stowing. Love this - I keep it in my car for those pop-up Florida showers.,a year ago
Annalyse,5,Love this product! Just had to order a new one. Highly Recommend!,a year ago
Sophie S,5,Cute color (peach) and truly waterproof! Bought for layering for skiing but wearing as a light jacket on rainy days too.,a year ago

Rylee W,5,"Lightweight, breathable, and waterproof. Just what I was looking for!",a year ago
Dee,5,"I bought this in Safari for a summer trip to Iceland, and it was PERFECT. It was easy to layer, lightweight, and it kept me completely dry. I love that it folds up. I hooked a keychain loop on the zipper of the left pocket (which is where it's folded into) so I could hook it onto my backpack. My only complaint is that there was nothing that explained that to fold the jacket you just shove it into the left pocket, which is an extremely minor complaint. I have no regrets with this purchase, and I fully expect to be wearing it on and off the trail!",a year ago
Stacie,5,Love the color and fit. I normally wear a large but purchased an XL because I want to be able to wear something heavy under it in the fall and winter so it will work nicely. I probably could have gone with a large and it would have been fine it is very generous. I do wish that the material was a little thicker just to give it a little weight but over all very good quality. The length of the jacket is good and the sleeve length is long so the velcro comes in handy to adjust them. I think I will get a lot of use out of this jacket in all 4 seasons. I purchased a the soft shell to wear under it in spring and fall and it will be perfect!,a year ago
N Gee,5,"A nice lightweight and breathable rain jacket. It's the perfect design, fun and stylish.",a year ago
Val,5,Good fit and quality. Columbia can trust to fit well.,a year ago
Paula,5,"Love it. Light jacket, very useful in warmer days when it is raining. Size follows same standards as other Columbia products.",a year ago
Elaine,5,Love the color and it fits perfectly. Color is titled 'Safari' & I will be using the jacket in the Amazon wilds!,a year ago
Reviewer,5,"I enjoy wearing this jacket. Very light and color is very popular among my friends. I sometimes have to walk the dog in rain and garden, it protects me from getting wet. I'm also very happy with xs sizing. I wear petite 2 and this was very good fit. Sleeves were long but there is a velcro to fasten to adjust the length. Very good quality and I'm very satisfied with the purchase.",a year ago
Kathy A,5,I love this rain jacket I have worn it several times for my walks on rainy days. It works well keeps you dry and is breathable very comfortable . Love the look and the colour I am very happy with my purchase .,a year ago
Kat,5,"I've been eyeing a Columbia rain jacket for awhile now and so glad I got one. Material is so great. It holds up wonderfully in even a downpour! I typically wear a large in shirts, so was thinking I would get an XL, but when I tried them on at the store, the Large in this jacket fit perfectly. The color is so beautiful, so will definitely feel stylish even in the rain!",2 years ago
Linda,5,I have had this jacket before and I misplaced it-I really missed it! I purchased a new one and I am really pleased,2 years ago
JenK,5,"I'm 5'2, 198# and bought the XXL. I love this jacket. It's been a while since I've owned a proper rain jacket and this works for me. I chose geranium because why not - it's a rain jacket and odds are it's an overcast day so I need to be seen. The fit is great, the zipper (so far) is sturdy. I've worn it more in the snowfall while taking out the dogs. Roomy pockets and quick to dry. I think will be good in summer and plan to take it with me on hikes.",2 years ago
Gator Girl,5,"I have 2 of these jackets: Black & Navy. My best friend loves my jacket so I bought her one for christmas. Jacket keeps you dry- it's a ""real"" rainjacket vs all the others that leak through material. It's lightweight and comfortable. Some rain jackets feel like plastic... this jacket fits good and doesn't feel like a plastic bag. I would highly recommend it to anyone. If I had any negative it would be to improve the hood- if it had an elastic cloth hoodie attached to the main hood, it would stay forward on your head better and keep the rain off your head better. I also wish they would offer other colors, like Pink, turquoise , etc.",2 years ago
Twin mom,5,"I have 2 of these jackets now, I love them. Keeps me dry and stops the wind!",2 years ago
Chris M,5,It’s comfortable and fits well. Exactly still wanted Excellent service assistance in placing my order,2 years ago

Can't wait to get a few more in other colors!",2 years ago

Lizi,5,This train jacket is lightweight and very eager resistant. Exactly the product I was looking for/ wanted.,2 years ago
Melissa,5,"I bought this jacket for a vacation where we did a lot of hiking. I was looking for a jacket that was waterproof and wind resistant. This jacket lived up to all my expectations. It kept me dry especially when the wind started blowing the rain. The only things I would change are zipper and add an inside pocket. I wish I could have unzipped the bottom, this would have made it easier bending down to tie shoes or picking up items easier.",2 years ago
Erin,5,"I had a Columbia rain jacket like this for years and wore it to tatters, plan to do the same for this one. I wanted the teal color but waited too long and it sold out in my size but actually the peach is gorgeous and I'm glad I got that one instead. Perfect for layering on my morning walks, I love how lightweight it is.",2 years ago
anna22,5,"I bought this knowing I would need it for football practice and training, but I have used it for so much more. The fit is amazing and the material is so lightweight that I forget I am even wearing it!",2 years ago
MJ,5,"Completely waterproof, comfy and easy to pack. Great lightweight rain jacket.",2 years ago
OutdoorFan,5,"I bought this rain jacket for my wife (who walks daily, rain or shine). Her former jacket left her coming in soggy all the way through, but now she stays dry through the heaviest of downpours. Points!!!",2 years ago
Vic Ky,5,I love this jacket. Bought it for a vacation since the area is known for rainfall out of nowhere. Fits well in most areas but snug on my breast (if you’re bigger than a 38DD(E) size up) I like a bit of tightness their though so I’m happy.,2 years ago
Ab,5,"My husband and I bought Columbia rain jackets for our trip to Iceland on a bit of a splurge for our budget, and we did not regret it. All I can say is that this rain jacket performed as well as any rain jacket up against those odds could. It was totally awesome. The only time it started to give out was when the rain combined with 30mph wind was basically sending stinging water bullets at us. Other than that I used it up to 5 hours at a time in heavy rain and it was just barely starting to get a bit waterlogged by the time we got out of the rain. It is super fast drying (we had only the confines of a camper van to hang clothes in), and works fabulously as a windbreaker. Overall, I would 100% buy this again in the same circumstances. The light blue color was so pretty!",2 years ago

Cat,5,I am very pleased with my purchase! I wasn't sure how the fit would be as I am normally a petite medium but the medium was perfect. I love that the jacket stuffs into its own pocket and makes it easy to pack for inclement weather.,3 years ago
Ellie,5,I love this coat so much make sure if you buy it you go one size up! It really is true to size as in it will fit like a shirt so if you’re a small or a six got up to a medium and it will give you much better space and you can wear a sweater with it. I love the colour and shipping was super fast. Over all if you’re thinking about this.... get it!!!,3 years ago
Kat74,5,"This is a great jacket, BUT, order a size up if you’re planning to layer. I’m 5’5” 157 lbs, and ordered the large. It’s fine alone, but not for layering. I’m returning for an XL.",3 years ago
Priscilla,5,"It fits good, the sleeves have the right measure and its very light, I love it",3 years ago
IMarie53,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The fit is good but I should have followed reviews and sized up for a little more room. It is lightweight (think spring and fall) but I bought to wear in warm climates where a rain jacket is needed (think rainforests.),3 years ago

chellaayy,5,"I purchased this rain jacket because it was described as lightweight, waterproof, and had the ability to pack into its pocket. The jacket did check all of those boxes and I was very pleased with its performance in a downpour!",3 years ago
AKJenny,5,"I have two of these, in two different sizes, one medium and one large. The medium is great for summer, when I don't have a lot of layers underneath. The large is a little big, but I can comfortably throw it on over anything I'm wearing that's not waterproof (cute work blazers??) and it keeps me protected through the unexpected. Very happy with this product, always a Columbia fan! (For ref, 5'8"", 145. I have really long arms, long torso, broad shoulders. This style does not narrow at the hips like some other Columbia coats)",3 years ago

Jewels20,5,"I ordered the Rouge Pink, Red Orchid and the color is beautiful. I ordered a Medium and am a 34DDD and it fits just fine a bit tight from the breast area not baggy at all only from the arm area. I think that the Large would fit me super baggy though. I think it will do it's job.",3 years ago
MADW,5,Loved the color and the texture of this jacket. It folds small to pack and is light weight!,3 years ago
Oreo9259,5,This jacket is very nice quality and has a vey appealing appearance. I order a size up in case you are wearing something heavy underneath. Fits very well.,3 years ago
PinkFlower,5,"Very pleased with purchase. I'm medium but the Large Size I bought fits perfectly with a little wiggle room. My actual medium size would have been too snug so that it why I chose (Runs a little small). I have very narrow shoulders and even the large fits perfectly around them, so definitely size up if you have broader shoulders.",3 years ago
KathyBee,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Ordered this jacket because my last one did not have an interior mesh lining. I wanted a jacket that would keep me cool in the humidity of the MS rain season. The day I got this I had to stand in the rain, and I didn't get wet at all! My mom ordered one after she saw mine and loves it too. I would recommend ordering a size with enough room to fit long sleeve shirts or sweaters if you want to wear this in the winter.",3 years ago

Canadian82,5,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) I've taken this jacket with me to Alaska, and the Canadian rainy west coast. Does a great job of keeping rain out.

Bsawyer,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this as a light weight option to wear in our crazy Washington state weather, I'm happy to say it works great! I often head to work during the warmest part of the day but come home at night when it's cooler. It's light enough to not make me hot, but warm enough for cooler evenings. Rain proof which comes in handy for unpredictable weather. Packable for camping and other trips. I am so happy I bought this.",3 years ago
Elizabeth7,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Needed a good lightweight jacket to be able to run in and this one is perfect!

DoggieMommie,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Flat out, this jacket is awesome. Lightweight, super breathable (wore it in 78 degree rainy weather to walk my dogs and DID NOT GET HOT- this is the first raincoat I’ve ever had that didn’t make me feel like I was getting a portable steam treatment!). The sleeves are the ideal length- come down over your hands a bit- cause who wants wet hands?- but could be kept back with the Velcro on the sleeves. The hood is perfect too- comes out over your face but not to the point that you can’t see, just enough to keep your cute mug from getting rained on. Pockets are huge and useful. As if that weren’t enough, the purple color is really pretty!! Seriously, this thing is awesome. Just get it. You won’t regret it!",3 years ago
CanyonWren,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Mine kept me dry on a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon last spring, and this one was for my daughter. Each of my kids and I have one of these jackets. They conveniently pack into their pockets for storage and are as thick and durable as you can get and still be fairly breathable. Fit is true to size.

It is adjustable at the hood, sleeves and bottom of the jacket for added protection in the elements. They adjust easily and are user friendly. The color, Buttercup that I ordered is great for visibility in the rain and on those not so sunny days when you may be walking or hiking. The sizing runs as expected. I ordered a large so that if needed it can be worn over other layers underneath. It is very comfortable and breathable. I have had many other rain jackets that are not as functional.

Mary1858,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently purchased this rain jacket because I was fed up with the cheaper rain coats I had been wearing. I was apprehensive to pay for a rain coat, however I live in Florida and was in desperate need of a light-weight rain coat for unexpected showers. This coat exceeded my expectations. The rain literally rolls right off of the jacket. I compared my jacket to friends jackets with seemingly similar brands and this Columbia jacket was far better at repelling rain drops. One of my favorite aspects of this jacket is that it is light-weight. It rolls up quite nicely into a large purse and is perfectly compact for taking on trips. I am 5'1"" and ordered an XS, the sleeves are a little long however the velcro at the cuff is very nice. The pockets are nice and large. I love the length of the jacket- it is not too short or too long. It falls just past my waist, but does not look like the coat is swallowing me up. All in all, this is jacket is a good investment and I do not see myself ordering a new rain jacket for years to come. Thanks Columbia!",4 years ago

I do however, love this jacket!",4 years ago
CatherineinBC,5,(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) As we move from winter to spring this is the prefect jacket to take along the way.

Limbrelemon,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a great jacket for Northern California weather and layering, and other similar climates. Ii am a student and I have to walk around campus tons, so in the winter months, I end up layering a lot. This jacket, which I think runs a little bit large In the way that all Columbia wear runs a little bit large, is the perfect outer piece for what I have come to think of as the NorCal winter uniform: comfy fitted base layer of either of a neutral color, cute, quality sweater, and then this jacket, because it blocks wind, is rain proof, but not bulky. I think it would be a similar essential for fall and spring in the northeast. It’s a great staple piece. I got the light purple, and I really love this color! I am buying a lot of Columbia pieces in this color because they go with most every color in my closet, and have the versatility of grey in wearing with any color boot.",4 years ago
Yarah,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It is perfect! The velcro of the sleeves allows me to adjust it at my convenience when I need it closer to the hand or a little higher on the arm. The fact that I can close it to the top of the neck is excellent for when I'm in a hurry and without an umbrella. Besides that it can be packed in the left pocket, I can also put it in compression cubes inside my backpack while traveling. It dries in a matter of minutes and I can pack it quickly. I really like the Buttercup color. My preference is to wear bright colors in rainy weather, because it makes me more visible to drivers or other passersby. Size S is a bit long for me, but I have a short torso. However, it does not bother me, since it can be adjusted at the bottom edge so I can take it to the hip with tight clothes without problems. Finally it is very light so I can wear layers of clothing according to the weather without having to pack multiple coats.",4 years ago

Erocks,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this jacket for a windbreaker / semi-raincoat. It's even better in person it cinches in just a little bit in the waist and gives a shape to it, so it's not boxy at all.",4 years ago

Maryann001,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love this little rain jacket! In South Carolina it tends to rain quite a bit in the winter, so it's been perfect for just that. It also can be super compact for traveling purposes, which I like. For anyone who needs a durable, reliable rain jacket, I 10/10 recommend this one! Keep in mind though, it's not super warm (so wear layers under it if you're cold), but it certainly keeps you dry!",4 years ago
Jeff2020,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this for my daughter that is going to school in Hilo Hawaii. The rainy season there is the real deal. She loves the jacket and it looks great on her. She told me it works perfect for the warm down pours and keeps her dry. Columbia is a great company,4 years ago

bet10,5,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) This is my 3rd windbreaker, it does exactly what it’s made for. Light, keeps the wind and water off. Highly recommend!",4 years ago
JodiLA,5,"This coat is a must have if you need to go outdoors even in the rain. I got them all x-large because I often hike with my SLR camera and I need to be able to put the camera under the coat. Binoculars as well. I am a guide in Hawaii, at the 4000 elevation it can be chilly, this jacket is perfect for hiking. Most of my other raincoats trap moisture in them so I end of up wet inside the jacket from humidity, not this jacket. Super breathable. I have also been caught in torrential rainstorms and it didn't leak. If I know I am going to be out all day and it's going to rain I'll bring a couple so I can change them out. Sometimes one of my customers forgets a windbreaker so I loan them one of these and they usually tell me how much they loved it and they want one too. It is also super soft and not hard and scratchy. I don't even touch my other raincoats anymore, I only use this one (I may need more colors). The pockets are extra roomy on these which is great as well.",4 years ago
HikerHeather,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a great jacket for wearing by itself in the rain or wearing over other jacket in winter. I bought this for both uses. Keep it with me when I am hiking with chance of rain. Also wear it over other jacket as an outer layer when skiing or hiking in winter. Also bought the insulated pants that match perfectly and are great when playing snow sports. Very windproof and the hood keeps me very dry and warm. Bought one and my friend liked it so well that I bought one for her too. She used it while hiking in Yosemite and loved it!,4 years ago
lolosha,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Excellent waterproof jacket with the perfect hood that keeps the rain out. I love the color (dark seas) too.

Would highly recommend for a functional rain jacket.",4 years ago
Abbyjk95,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just repurchased after 7 wonderful years with my first one. It saw lots of wear and tear through college and lots of traveling and hikes upon hikes. I got a large so I could wear it on top of layers and it’s perfect.

Most importantly, it is truly waterproof! My family and I were outside tonight in pouring nonstop rain, and this jacket kept me perfectly dry! The rain just slid right off and when I got home and noticed a few drops still on it, I shook the jacket and they came right off! Meanwhile my sons’ winter jackets had soaked up all the rain and they were drenched. I’ve never been this impressed with a jacket. I’m planning on buying this for my husband and sons as well now. I would even buy more for myself in different colors! I love it!",4 years ago
Coastalrunner,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve tried several brands of “waterproof” rain jackets and none have been as effective as this Arcadia II!

I also love the fact that you can roll it up and stuff it in a backpack and it comes out looking fine. We are headed to the Amazon for a river cruise so I had to get a light colored jacket. This is the only one that I would’ve considered taking. I got the second one in Lilac the first was in dark purple but because mosquitos are attracted to dark colors I need a lighter color. This should do perfectly.,4 years ago

It is true that it “crackles” a little when walking but it feels very solid. My usual size is medium to large. I got the jacket in large and it fits nicely over a fleece. It is light weight and packs pretty compact. I got it in black so that it doubles as a city jacket when traveling.,4 years ago

ElaineNOLA,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Perfect rain jacket/light wind breaker. I sized up according to other reviews and glad I did. The sleeves are adjustable so that's not an issue for length, and I love the longer length in the body. The shape is still great even tho it's not ""fitted."" This way I can layer a fleece pullover underneath if needed. It is usually warm here, so I wanted something lightweight.",5 years ago
Jules18,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We live in SoCal and it has been raining a lot! This jacket provides my daughter (5'5"", 110lbs) with great support and she can layer a sweater underneath. It is light and will not provide a lot of warmth, which is perfect for our climate. It is a beautiful color and looks high quality. Enjoy!",5 years ago
Valer,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received my new Columbia rain jacket just in time for the many rain storms this season in California.

FrannyT,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This jacket is absolutely waterproof. I went for a 45 minute run in a steady rain, Stayed totally dry underneath except for sweat. I really like the hood, stayed put even with wind. This has a mesh lining not only in the body but in the sleeves as well which is pretty unusual. I like it. I also appreciate the adjustable wrist strap in the cold.",5 years ago

court929,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This jacket fit me perfectly — I got a size S and I’m 5’5, 120lbs.

I’d recommend this to anyone searching for a rain jacket to wear in the warmer months.",5 years ago

Laureli,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love the tourquoise color and mesh liner. Perfect summer rain jacket. Other brands aren’t waterproof or have itchy liners. Large enough to layer in the spring.,5 years ago
jtc12,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This jacket really does its job and protects you from wind and rain. The small size fits well over my Columbia fleece jacket (also small) for added warmth too. I can add layers underneath without it being too tight.,5 years ago
AC36,5,"(This review was collected as part of a promotion.) Wow! I like the color! Very thin, it is perfect for cool summer evenings and rainy days. Mesh fabric on the inside prevents sticking to the waterproof outer layer when it is warmer. A must to have in his wardrobe! I will not do without it, I recommend it.",5 years ago
CLScott,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve had this rain jacket for many years in black, but I found it on sale and decided to get a new color. Same great quality as years ago. It’s roomy enough to fit my fleece under it on chillier days. The only complaint I have is the hood could come down a bit more over your head so it stays on better and keeps your face drier, but it functions just fine as is. Glad the quality hasn’t changed in all these years.",5 years ago

NancV,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased 2 of these jackets for an upcoming trip to Alaska. While we haven't worn them yet it is clear to see that the jackets are very well made. We like that they pack within one of the pockets. I have since seen 33% cheaper jackets in the market but take solace in the quality and packable option of our jackets. I went up 1 size to a large to allow for layering but was surprised when a large doesn't allow for much layering. Cannot speak to how much layering room exists w XL ordered as I bought that for someone else. She did respond that jacket is going to work for layering, but, again, I cannot say how much layering exists on that jacket.",5 years ago

Render,5,"This product is amazing. The inside pocket is perfect, the hood is great, the velcro holds up and it stays waterproof. This thing is pretty dang waterproof. I was standing in the pouring raining for several hours with this jacket and besides the minimal expected moisture, it kept me from being as miserable as my coworker who didn't have a raincoat. I bought an xs small and it fits perfect. I'm 5'1, roughly 115lb. I've had this same jacket for over 5 years now and it's still my go-to jacket, rain or shine.",5 years ago
Chobani,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When I got it in the mail I was sooo happy. It came in just in time too because the next day it started raining.

Leslie28,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchased this for those rainy Florida afternoons when I have to walk and pick my daughter up from school. This jacket is great! It’s light so you don’t get too hot. Also, very well made and keeps you perfectly dry. I’m 5’4” and average build. I usually wear a Medium, but I ordered a Large and I am glad I did cause I like a loose fit. It is perfect for my use.",5 years ago
Jhene,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this product right before i took off to Seattle and it worked like a charm. I purchased a size medium which was a little bigger but it’s exactly what i wanted so i could layer up. I love how the sleeves adjust next to my wrist to prevent any cold air going inside of the jacket. Definitely recommend. Definitely looking into buying the same jacket in another color.,5 years ago

RachL89,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have searched for years to find a raincoat that is actually waterproof and offers some warmth and boy did I find it. I got it in a light lavender and the color is stunning. I am 5'3, 155 pounds and got a medium and it fits well with some room for a sweatshirt to wear under it. The lining is nice enough to add some warmth but is perfect for a rainy spring day. The hood covers ALL of your head and has an extra lip to protect your face and glasses. I would buy this rain coat again in a hot second.",5 years ago
Allid,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great rain coat that is truly waterproof. It ran true to size for me (xl). I wish it had a slightly deeper hood because I wear my hair up in a bun a lot which causes the hood to not completely cover my face.,5 years ago
JCar,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this for my daughter for this coming spring. She loves the dark plum color and fit. The weight of the jacket is perfect for spring days and will keep her dry. I bought a Medium so she has room to grow. The sizing chart really helped with deciding on what size to get. I’m very happy with the purchase.,5 years ago

Wear a lightweight fleece under and you have a very versatile jacket.,5 years ago
Outdoorgirl19,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great jacket. Love that the sleeves, bottom and hood are all adjustable. I got Dark Ivy and while it looks blue-green/aqua colored on the website, it is actually more of a dark forest green or British racing green.",5 years ago
LivEe,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product was originally bought for my trip to Alaska in the summer, but a few days ago I tested it out on the could winters of Idaho.

Trackster,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this jacket! I coach track, and it rains a lot in Oregon. This jacket is great, adjustable sleeves, the hood actually covers your head (most do not) it does run a little small. I sized up after returning another jacket. It is also cold in the winter and early spring so I need a warm layer underneath. Hence the reason for sizing up.",5 years ago

Jmpw,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wore today in pouring rain and it kept me completely dry. The hood is plenty big to cover your head and hair. I like that you can tighten the sleeves as sleeves tend to be too long on me and by tightening them, they don’t come down over my hands. Coat also did not absorb any water and I was in rain for a while loading groceries into car.",5 years ago
janice61,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I previously owned the jacket in Navy and was still wearing it in the rainy weather.

I love the maroon color.,5 years ago
MickeyBEG,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought to use during rainy walks in and around town and works great.

How can you beat this functionality at under $35 for the discontinued color!,5 years ago

It fits great and doesn't go under my butt (which is what I wanted, I don't like long jackets). It is big enough to layer with a puffy jacket underneath, but not so big that it looks baggy without layering. I ordered the Dark Plum and it's gorgeous, jut like the picture on the website.",5 years ago

Watty,5,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this jacket as a present for my sister when she moved to a rainy state. She was so impressed that the rain beaded up on the jacket and rolled right of, she said “I’ve never had a truely rainproof jacket until now”. This jacket is now her every day jacket and is easy to wear over anything. She did recommend that if you want to wear more than one sweatshirt underneath that you should size up. It is a thin shell jacket with a mesh lining so your skin doesn’t touch the slick rainproof material, which is really nice if you’re wearing short sleeves and start to sweat.",5 years ago
Redjacket,5,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love it. Very pretty and comfortable,5 years ago
PennStateatNCSea,5,"I bought 3 to compare and this one was the BEST! Flexible outer shell and mesh lining. Lightweight, but warm and thin enough for every day but NOT enough room for sweater underneath. Had to return and order 1 size larger just to wear alone and be comfy and to be long enough in the back. More like a teenage look if tighter, wanted it loose fitting-may even do 2 sizes bigger. Totally waterproof!! And the Dynasty blue is so pretty! My teenage daughters want the same color!! It is a lighter, brighter, navy blue, yet not too light so still makes me look thinner!I personally don't like the flap over the zipper, but on this coat, that is what makes it waterproof in front. Sale price is amazing for this coat!",5 years ago

It’s been down in the 40’s and 50’s which is not cold enough for the parka, but perfect for my Arcadia II. I love the plum color, it goes with just about everything. This jacket will get me through what little rain we get here and keep me comfortable through most of our cooler days in fall, winter, and spring. It’s light enough to go anywhere.",5 years ago
