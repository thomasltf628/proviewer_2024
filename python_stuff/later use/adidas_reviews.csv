Gersman,5,Great quality and value for money. Would recommend this to anyone.,"April 9, 2024"
Hannah,5,"They are definitely a lighter tan they look in the photos online, but still cute &amp; a great fit. I wear a women's size 8 and ordered the size 7 in these &amp; they fit perfect.","April 9, 2024"
Zewe,1,"Got the pair with silver stripes but no good, unfortunately. Not sure what adidas was thinking with the tongue design - it's hard, plasticky, and super long. It digs in the ankle and just feels and looks cheap/terrible. There are much better models out there, the gazelles with plastic tongue definitely don't do it for me. Would not recommend.","April 9, 2024"
Srp1,5,Great fit and comfortable. Quality is good too. Would buy again,"April 9, 2024"

Jacob,5,Color is exactly what I was looking for to finish my outfit,"April 8, 2024"
Spud,5,I do quite abit of walking  and these were comfy from the first time I put them on better with the gum colour sole.  Doesn’t look to get so dirty,"April 7, 2024"
Di593,4,"Simple style. Can wear with just about anything. Personally I felt this shoe ran a little small. This is my first pair of adidas. I usually wear Converse or Vans. I wear a 7.5  in women’s (5.5 in men’s). I ordered a 7.5 and they were a bit too snug. Had to exchange them for a size 8 and they fit perfectly now.
The only thing that I Dislike about this shoe is the plastic tongue. It creaks/squeaks all the time. And the shoe does have glue in a couple spots. It’s very noticeable since the shoe is all black but once they are on it’s not very noticeable","April 7, 2024"

SC2K,5,"Tried many and this was the winner.  Based on the size guide I would be a 13.5 US, mens but many of these Adidas don't offer but a 13 or 14.  I tried the Samba OG, Special, Stan Smith and finally the Gazelle.  Gotta say the Gazelle is the best fitting for my foot type.  It's definitely wider than the Spezial and Stan Smith which felt very narrow.  The Gazelle felt comfortable right out of the box and would definitely recommend.  Glad I finally found a pair that not only feel comfortable but look very stylish.","April 7, 2024"
BSGG,5,"Great shoes but why are the SL 72 RS sold out? You are Adidas, you make shoes, right?","April 7, 2024"

KevinS,4,"Very comfortable right out the box, purchased these for a trip and expect todo some walking but also wanted a sneaker that would look good enough to wear with chinos and a Botton down shirt. Would prefer a softer leather tongue, hence 4 stars instead of 5.","April 5, 2024"

CatM,1,"Ordered 2 pairs, got a notification arriving early. Sat at airport for 3 days, said delivered at 5 in the morning, but no evidence on cams that there was even an attempt. Now waiting with no evidence besides my screen captures that I've filled a complaint. They ""may issue a refund"". But I'm the meantime, I should just go buy the shoes at my local Adidas store. 
1) send me documentation
2) don't use your own questionable delivery service (really, 5 am at the beginning of a snow storm after sitting for 3 days with no update on texting)
3) if I had time to go to the store, I would have already gone! But, no time, not in stock in the size color I want. 

Take home, love the shoes, but buy through some one else or at a store. Do not buy through the online store. 

Now I've a 3 week trip starting without the shoes I ordered over 10 days ago that were supposed to be here 5 days ago. And when you have a broken for and 2 messed up knees over the course of the last year... It's not like just any shoes will do!
