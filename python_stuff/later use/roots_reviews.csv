C. Mc,5,"Although very pricey, these sweatpants are good quality and there is a size small enough to fit my 5'7"" very thin daughter! Thank you Roots for having this size!!",2024-04-02
Yutta,1,"I like the pants and they fit really well. However the first day I wore them, I noticed that there was elastic in the bottom and it
had not been tightened. Therefore they were held up with shoes and slippers but dragged on the ground with bare feet. I don‚Äôt return things by mail, only if there‚Äôs a store in town. I‚Äôm wearing them but I‚Äôm disappointed, especially for the price.",2024-04-02
cperry,5,"I love this pair of pants. They are very comfortable here in Southern California whether the weather is cool or warm. They wash easily. I had knee surgery earlier this year, and these pants were easy to slip into. My knee is fine now, but I continue to wear them. They go well with a variety of tops",2024-04-01

Dissatisfied2024,1,"These sweatpants are not the roots quality you are expecting, they do not keep their shape and stretch out very quickly with minimal wear. It‚Äôs unfortunate. Customer service was not able to help me at this time. I wish I had purchased the (non organic) original sweatpants.",2024-03-29
A.Boone,5,I bought these sweatpants over 10 years ago and I am still wearing them. They are pricey for just sweatpants but they will definitely stand the test of time. Roots has the BEST sweatpants ever!,2024-03-23

Terralyn,1,Thin material wouldn‚Äôt recommend for winter and starting to pill,2024-03-10
AmWy,2,"Fabric is much thinner than I would expect from roots. It‚Äôs still nice and soft inside, but feels cheap and pills and pulls easily on the outside. Not something I want to have to wash often because I‚Äôm not sure it will stand up to regular washing over time, which means I can‚Äôt wear it as often, so disappointing for the price. The reason I buy Roots is because it lasts‚Ä¶I likely won‚Äôt purchase this line again.",2024-03-10

TLAD,5,The sweatpants are soft and very comfortable. I'm happy with the purchase!,2024-03-06
Shrinkifacation!,4,"Both sizing and composition different from previous sweatpants. I ordered the same exact size and style and they are WAY smaller. I‚Äôll have to size up one or maybe two sizes, or switch to a different style as the legs seem a lot slimmer than previous. Will have to go in store to try on unfortunately which really defeats the purpose of the online order! They seem cozy and",2024-03-03

Apple99,4,"I bought the original salt & pepper fit in the winter of 2022, and only use it in winters so I‚Äôve gotten about 12mths of usage out of these expensive pants before they wore out badly.
Liked the fit and warmth in winter but expected better quality from a brand like Roots.",2024-02-26

Riham,1,"Ordered pink organic originalsweatpant, paid full price and expected a good quality from Roots, I was shocked when I received my order seeing the fabric is already lint before wearing it or washing it. It's not my first roots sweatpant. Very disappointed.",2024-01-15

Ontario shopper 44,2,"I have been buying these for my daughters for years. The quality and fabric has really gone downhill. They‚Äôre so thin and the fabric feels very cheap. Roots sweats used to be such nice quality, unfortunately this may be our last pair.",2023-12-06
Shan111,2,"I've been buying these sweatpants for years (potentially decades). This is the first time that the sizing has been waaaayyyy off. I think they were made for someone who's 6'5"", not someone who's 5'6"". The material and durability of these sweatpants has me coming back year after year. But the length has changed so I had to return them.",2023-12-01
A lost customer,1,I bought these a few short months ago and after 10-15 wears and a couple of washes the material is fuzzy and pilling everywhere. Very poor quality. Roots quality has gone downhill; I have other pairs from 15 years ago that are still going strong. Disappointing.,2023-12-01
Materialsucks24,3,"I absolutely love these sweatpants. They are incredibly comfortable, soft and warm. However, the material is horrible. Every single pair of these pants I have purchased has frayed in the inner thigh area after only wearing them once or twice. As a result, it causes the material to fade very fast. No other sweatpants from a h other company does this. It‚Äôs beyond frustrating to spend this kind of money on sweatpants that get ruined quickly. I‚Äôve given up buying these pants.",2023-12-01

Car J,5,"whats not to love - soft, warm and cozy. love roots sweatpants",2023-11-02
LKP123,2,I'm so disappointed in how huge these are. I had an older pair in a medium that fit perfect so naturally I bought the same size. After wearing them and even washing and drying them they are still so big and they stretch out every time I wear them. They fit more like an XL! This is so much money for me to spend on a pair of track pants for them to be a waste.,2023-11-01

Moth,5,"Just what I wanted. Nice weight, prefect fit. Just the ticket!",2023-10-24
Annelise,5,Super comfy fit - my old roots from 2011 died this year (2023) and these looked similar. They are both XL and I will say the new ones have a slimmer fit but the old ones were a bit too large so it worked out. They have nice pockets on the sides and are soft on the inside. Hope they last me a decade!,2023-10-21
AlannahC,5,"So in love. I bought my last pair in 2017 whilst visiting Canada, so glad they are still making them and I could get a pair to come over to Australia with my friend",2023-10-09

Nica,5,"Love these sweatpants, they fit great, definitely classic fit and I got a medium, so not tight and plenty of room. Love the salt and pepper color too.",2023-06-29
villa,1,"I purchased 4 sweat pants online, and was confident doing this because roots in the past was great. They are horribly made and fit horribly, baggy in tummy area and tight in the rear area. Super long, you have to be 6' tall. They look like something you might buy from Walmart, poor quality all round and they have a scented chemical smell. They make the return process difficult, says easy return, because you have to go the store to return, why would I shop online then? Never shopping from Roots again.",2023-06-22

Ann S,1,"I‚Äôm very disappointed. I love all my previous Roots purchases, but these sweatpants are a big ‚ÄòNO‚Äô for me. I washed them first before wearing them and I wondered why they were so scratchy on my legs. Wore them two more times and noticed they are made with recycled plastic( and cotton). Love the idea of recycling, however, my skin isn‚Äôt happy with the texture. My old Roots sweatpants will have to do for now.",2023-03-06

Fishchic,4,"Have had these for about 2 years. Worn and washed many times over and they still look like I just bought them. My only complaint is if I'm not wearing socks, the elastic at the ankle slips under my feet.

Rachel24b,4,"I've had these sweats for a while now. I love them. They wash well and feel great. The only gripe I have with them, is that the pockets aren't big enough for the phones that are now on the market. My phone has dropped out of my pocket several times and it's really annoying. Maybe roots should change the poket size to accommodate the newer phones. Other than that, the pants are fantastic!",2023-02-02

Nicole1139,4,"I‚Äôve owned these sweatpants for YEARS. Super cozy, and as flattering as any sweatpants could be. Only issue is that I find that every pair I have the crotch eventually wears out. I find that the fabric is thinner there(maybe for comfort?) but in the past two pairs I‚Äôve bought that has happened. I still continue to buy them though because I love them. I hope this could be a future improvement.",2023-02-02
Dannn,5,Super comfortable! Bought one and lasted me for a few years‚Ä¶ 2-3 even 4 years later I‚Äôm down to my 2nd pair!
